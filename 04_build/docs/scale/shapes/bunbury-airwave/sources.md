Re-done 2026-10-05 (resume run; the 2026-10-04 draft was treated as unverified notes). Every file in `src/` is listed here.

Removed from `src/` on 2026-10-05 (not used): `img3` Airwave-Tear.jpg (underwater close-up of the torn seam, no plan information; https://raisedwaterresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Airwave-Tear.jpg) and `sat3` Esri Wayback release 4756 (2019-12-12) tile, whose imagery at this spot dates from 2016-03-03, i.e. before the reef existed; the next release (2020-01-08) postdates removal. No satellite imagery can show this reef.

## Design version
Only one version was ever built: the single 12 m inflatable bladder installed (about 90% complete) and torn (seam tear spotted by a diver on Fri 13 Dec 2019, reported by ABC on Mon 16 Dec). Its profile was asymmetric ('skateboard ramp', Bottegal in Tracks 2021) on a circular base. The planned redesign has only been tank-tested, never installed. `img5` and `img2` are pre-install concept graphics of the same circular dome, not alternatives. See `shape.json` -> `design_version`.

## Gemini checks (originals fetched by us, 2026-10-05; nothing from Gemini used)

| Bottegal, T. (2019) 'The Airwave Artificial Reef Project Brief' | unverifiable | no such document found online |
| Surfer Magazine 'The Bunbury Airwave Trial Review (2020)' | unverifiable | no such article found; the magazine was on hiatus 2020 to Aug 2024 |

| Gemini's own shape (reef_footprints.json id 'bunbury') | formula, not a trace | regular 24-gon R = 6.0 m centred 38 m from an invented origin; its coordinates (-33.3362, 115.6261) are ~1 km south of the real site. Other Gemini claims (helical screw anchors, 130 t, crest 1.8 m, 'Airwave Ltd', hemispherical dome, zero refraction) contradicted by sources, see `shape.json` -> `gemini.other_claims_checked` |

## Notes
- `img1` and `img4` show the same scene (same buoy, tether line and ring/valve mark): corroborating, not independent, evidence.
- Neither carries a scale bar or geo-reference; the 12 m scale comes from text (ABC, Raised Water Research, Bunbury Mail), so size agreement with the text is by construction. See `METHOD.md`.

## Verification additions (2026-10-05)
- Text sources added to `shape.json` references: R5 (RWR tear post, host of img1), R9 (Tracks 2021-10-08, profile and redesign), R10a (Tracks 2019-11-15, 12 m / 1.6 m / ~45 m off low-tide mark), R10b (Tradie 2019-01-31, circular base; seen in search-result text only, page 403 to scripts).
- A fifth RWR image (profile-page hero `uploads/2019/09/Airwave-From-Above.jpg`, 700x467 oblique) was looked at but is not in `src/` and is not used for any number.
- All four image sources re-downloaded and md5-matched on 2026-10-05 (img4 matches the project video frame; the ABC video page is live).
