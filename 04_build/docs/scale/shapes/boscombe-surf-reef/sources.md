No new images were saved. Text sources used for the dimension check (Wikipedia, Raised Water Research, Herbert et al. 2017, council releases of 12 Aug and 24 Oct 2011, BBC 15 Aug 2011) are listed in shape.json references. Overlays added: overlays/img1_verify_closeup.png, overlays/img3_relief_footprint_verify.png (derived from img1 and img3; same private-research-copy status). overlays/img1_outline_on_2025.png was re-rendered.
