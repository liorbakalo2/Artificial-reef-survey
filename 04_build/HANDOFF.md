# 04_build HANDOFF (page build) - 3D models tab round 11 finished 2026-10-07

Read this instead of re-reading src/. Briefs: the 3D tab = `_agent_briefs/build_3d_tab.md` (round 9, DONE), `build_3d_tab_r2.md` (round 10, DONE) and
`build_3d_tab_r3.md` (round 11, DONE, section 1); the rest of the page (Shapes tab, Videos tab, Images tab, reef-dialog changes, Methods tab) =
`_agent_briefs/build_shapes_videos.md` (NOT done, section 12). Step logs: `04_build/QA/round9_3d_LOG.md`, `round10_3d_LOG.md`, `round11_3d_LOG.md`
(round 11 = two agents; the log has a checkpoint section). Rules followed: `_agent_briefs/common.md`. User-facing docs: `README.md` section "3D models
tab", `UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` (how to bring in model updates), schemas `data/SCHEMA.md` ("models3d.json", "models3d_combined.json", "Round 11 additions").

## 1. Status per stage (2026-10-07)
| stage | status | confidence / reason |
|---|---|---|
| Tabs Gallery / Map / Table / Scale | unchanged (round 10: view buttons in the sticky top bar, short intro with (i)) | high: `check.py` 0 failures |
| 3D tab mechanics (round 9 + 10): discovery, viewers, key numbers, caveats, methods, references, full screen, selector, All (compare) | built, tested | high for the mechanics; per-model numbers are only as good as each model's METHODS_3D |
| Round 11 models: Borth, Boscombe (extended seabed), Mount Maunganui added/updated; 6 models, 6/6 in the combined scene | built | each model medium confidence except Prattes LOW |
| Round 11 combined-scene fixes (Lior's screenshot): Boscombe beach + shoreline, ONE scale bar, labels without overlap inside the canvas | built, QA 80 checks | high |
| Round 11 collapsible panels (combined layout panel, every viewer's side panel, page right panel; kept through full screen) | built | high |
| Round 11 "Match this photo" (30 plan-view pictures, overlay + slider + Reset view) | built; corner-geometry test for every picture | high for the camera maths; registration accuracy = the residual in `photo_match.json` |
| Outline versions with the REAL models (Borth 3, Mount Maunganui 2) | built; a live-switch bug in the old toggle found and fixed (section 6) | high |
| One-command refresh `src\update_page.py` + `UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` | built, tested end to end incl. a real change | high |
| Shapes / Videos / Images tabs, reef-dialog 3D embed, Methods tab | NOT started | next agent (section 12) |

## 2. Pipeline and commands (run from 04_build\)
```
python src\update_page.py              # ONE command: detect -> backup -> compile_data -> build -> check -> summary (--fast no Chrome, --full + all QA, --dry, --force-export)
python src\compile_data.py             # 02_research cards -> data\reefs.json (+ copies Lior's figures/video frames to assets\<slug>\)
python src\build.py                    # RUNS src\compile_models3d.py (which runs photo_match.ensure + src\export_combined.py), then inlines css/js/json into template.html
python src\check.py                    # static + [3D] block + DOM checks in own Chrome (90 s) -> QA\build_check.txt ; exit 1 on FAIL ; --no-dom skips Chrome (5 s)
python src\qa_models3d.py --prefix round11_3d   # 162 DOM checks (its own 79 + qa_round11.py's 83) + 41 screenshots QA\round11_3d_*.png, report QA\round11_3d_checks.txt (5 min)
python src\qa_round11.py --prefix round11_3d    # only the round-11 checks (combined labels / scale bar, panels, versions with real models, photo match)
python src\qa_versions_synth.py --prefix round11_3d   # versions feature with a synthetic model in a temp sandbox (27 checks)
python src\photo_match.py              # (optional) recompute data\photo_match.json and print every picture with its residual and every exclusion
python src\export_combined.py [--force] [slug]   # combined export alone; prints every check (cached by signature)
```
Never hand-edit artificial_reefs.html. The page needs `assets\`, `3d\`, `docs\` next to it; works from file:// (no server). Backups: page before round 9
`QA\prev\artificial_reefs_before_round9_3d.html`; page + src before round 10 `QA\prev\round9\`, before round 11 `QA\prev\round10\`, rolling copy of the page
before the latest update_page run `QA\prev\last_update\`. Headless QA: ALWAYS our own Chrome on a random free port + fresh profile (`src\qa_cdp.py`).
Shell quirks: the Bash tool rejects some long heredocs with quotes; PowerShell here is 5.1 (no heredocs, `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes a BOM): write patch
scripts with the Write tool. Console is cp1255: scripts that print non-ASCII call `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")`.

## 3. Module map (src\)
| file | what it does | 3D-tab hook |
|---|---|---|
| compile_data.py | reads the 13 verified cards -> data\reefs.json; round 11: no longer sweeps `assets\images\` (3D picture copies) into QA\removed_assets | none |
| build.py | derived fields (USD, map checks), runs compile_models3d, inlines everything | markers /*__M3D_CSS__*/, /*__M3D_JS__*/, __DATA3D__ |
| template.html, styles.css, app.js, scale.js | page skeleton, tokens, gallery/map/table/dialog, (i) primitive, Scale tab | hooks for `models3d` view, hash regexes, `unloadAll()`, `ReefInfo` |
| compile_models3d.py (~1000 lines) | ALL data work of the 3D tab (section 4); copies viewers + injects back bar, compact-embed CSS, collapsible-panel CSS/JS (`BAR_CSS`) and the photo-match receiver (`inject_receiver`); curated `{{tokens}}` (`fill_tokens`); hold list; prunes stale picture copies; `build_combined()` | writes data\models3d.json, 3d\, assets\images\ |
| export_combined.py | build-time export of reef + seabed meshes from each copied viewer (section 4b) | 3d\combined\<slug>.js, export_cache.json |
| combined_viewer.html | template of the combined viewer: shared scale bar, screen-space labels, collapsible layout panel | -> 3d\combined\index.html |
| photo_match.py | transforms of the plan-view pictures (section 4c) -> data\photo_match.json; `ensure()` recomputes only when an input changed | read by compile_models3d |
| pm_receiver.js | "Match this photo" receiver injected at the END of each viewer's last module script (sees `camera`, `controls`) | message contract in SCHEMA.md |
| models3d.js (~780 lines) / models3d.css | the tab UI (one IIFE `window.ReefModels3D`): selector, stage, photo panel (+ match row), versions (reload of the live viewer), panels, full screen | reads `#data3d` |
| update_page.py | one-command refresh (UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md) | state in data\update_state.json |
| qa_cdp.py | tiny Chrome DevTools driver (random port, fresh profile) | used by every QA script |
| qa_models3d.py / qa_round11.py / qa_versions_synth.py / check.py / qa_shots.py | QA (section 7) | `dom_checks()`, `dom_checks11()` imported by check / update_page |

## 4. Data flow (3D tab)
```
07_scale\shapes\<slug>\3d\{index.html,model.js,docs.js,annotated\,preview_oblique.png}  + {METHODS_3D,SOURCES_3D,REQUESTS_FOR_LIOR,FEASIBILITY}.md (READ-ONLY)
07_scale\shapes\<slug>\shape.json (traces, scale, georef, canonical outline, outline_versions)    03_images\reefs\<slug>\images.json (registry, display!=false)
04_build\data\models3d_curated.json | models3d_caveats.json | models3d_combined.json | models3d_hold.json | models3d_text\{methods,combined_method}.md   (ours)
        |  src\compile_models3d.py  (photo_match.ensure -> discover -> parse model.js -> versions -> pictures + match -> tokens -> render markdown -> verify -> merge refs -> combined)
        v
04_build\data\models3d.json --inlined as <script id="data3d">--> artificial_reefs.html (2.1 MB; WARN above 15 MB)     data\photo_match.json  data\update_state.json
04_build\3d\<slug>\   viewer copy (index.html rewritten: vendored three, bar, compact + panel CSS/JS, receiver; model.js, docs.js, annotated\ <=1200 px, poster.jpg)
04_build\3d\combined\ index.html, manifest.js, <slug>.js (exported meshes), export_cache.json     3d\vendor\ three.js 0.170 (classic bundle)
04_build\assets\images\<slug>\<regid>.<png|jpg>, <regid>_400.jpg, <regid>_annK.<ext>  (<=1600 px; generated, pruned by compile_models3d; never inlined)
```
Discovery: every `07_scale\shapes\<slug>\3d\` with `index.html` + `model.js` is a model unless listed in `data\models3d_hold.json`; `FEASIBILITY.md` only ->
"not modelled" card; neither -> "not yet modelled". Models are listed alphabetically; the first is the selector default (now Borth).
Picture selection (per model): registry rows with display!=false AND (used_for contains plan_trace|scale|3d_*|cross_check|camera_match, OR linked_records mention
3d\SOURCES_3D / model.js, OR file/annotated_files in 3d\annotated, OR for_3d_check.pending); a row corrected to `context` only (Boscombe img-01, img-07) drops out and its
stale copy is pruned. Per-model facts come from model.js with tolerant adapters. Curated text may carry `{{path|fmt}}` tokens read from model.js (Mount Maunganui bed,
Borth versions); a model without a curated entry gets auto fallbacks.

### 4b. Combined "All (compare)" scene - method
1. `export_combined.py` opens each COPIED viewer in own headless Chrome; a Scene subclass registered before the viewer runs records every scene (no viewer file changed).
2. Visible meshes with >= 100 vertices are read in WORLD coordinates: largest plan bbox = seabed (Boscombe now x -160..160, y -66..650: beach + offshore); same bbox = skirt;
   inside = reef. What the viewer shows at load is exported (default state / default outline version).
3. Rotation about the vertical so offshore = +z (`offshore_scene_xz`, `hand` per slug). Frames: X = x, Z = y (Prattes, Boscombe, Mount Maunganui, Borth), Bunbury Z = -y, Palm Beach ENU.
   Round 11: `polygon` may be several rings; `area_ref_expr` compares the mesh with a model.js area that includes the flank skirt (Borth: incl. toe berm; Mount Maunganui:
   footprint at the bed); `shore_mode: crossing`; `sublabels` (Borth: surf reef vs breakwater).
4. Checks per model (footprint area, centroid, crest, shoreline, slope direction; tolerances in the config) - 6/6 pass; footprint 11,922 / 4,868 / 112 / 1,904 / 12,537 / 478 m2 (exported).
5. Output uint16-quantised base64 in `3d/combined/<slug>.js`; cache signature = viewer html + model.js + exporter + config entry (~7 s per changed model).
6. The combined viewer (round 11): ONE shared scale bar (100 m, tick at 50 m; sits at the first visible patch, moves to the reef last flown to; overlay: bottom-left); reef labels are
   HTML in screen space with candidate offsets, leader lines and clamping into the visible area (clear of the layout panel); the camera fit uses the stage width minus the panel
   and re-fits when the frame is resized unless the user moved the camera; "Hide" / bottom-left "Layout" buttons collapse the layout panel (only phones < 600 px start collapsed).

### 4c. "Match this photo" - method (round 11, `src/photo_match.py`)
Per picture a similarity pixel -> canonical metres (canonical = shape.json frame = model.js frame; checked per model: `frame_check`). Methods: `georef` (pixel -> Web-Mercator bounds of the
image -> local metres -> canonical, similarity fitted on canonical.polygons_m vs geo.polygons_latlon; geo-fit residual 0.005-0.15 m), `direct` (vertex-for-vertex Umeyama fit of the traced
rings onto the canonical outline or an outline version that lists the source), `icp` (pictures with a stated px/m: raster cross-correlation over rotation, trimmed ICP, only the proper-handedness
variant of the viewer), Navionics (centre lat/lon + zoom + crop of the capture log: Borth, Mount Maunganui, Palm Beach 982 x 655 clips; Boscombe a 1000 x 751 map pane inside 1400 x 900;
Bunbury and Prattes excluded: no geo in shape.json). Residual = symmetric RMS boundary distance trace vs outline (outer rings only). Tolerance 2 m, 10 % of the length for reefs < 40 m,
4 m for georef pictures (edge definition differs between years / definitions, the registration is exact). Excluded: oblique (Bunbury img4), uncalibrated (Bunbury img5), mirrored fit,
Boscombe img2 / img3 (4.6 / 5.0 m: contour colour edge / design-stage outline), Palm s2 (dark rock only, 28 m), Prattes img6 (1996 concept, 4 m).
Eligible 30: Borth 8 (sat2024 0.0 m, sat2022 2.2, sat2012 3.3, drg1020 0.13, 4 Navionics), Boscombe 6 (img1 + 5 Navionics), Bunbury 1 (img1, 0.23 m), Mount Maunganui 7 (img1 0.15, img2 0.77,
img3 0.02, 4 Navionics), Palm Beach 6 (s7 0.0, s4 1.1, 4 Navionics), Prattes 2 (img1 0.0, img5 0.19); max trace residual 3.25 m (Borth sat2012).
Viewer side (`pm_receiver.js`): narrow-FOV (8 deg) top-down camera over the picture centre, picture up = screen up (camera a hair behind the bottom edge), overlay `<div id=m3d-pmo>`
sized from the ground footprint, side panels folded while matching, Reset restores camera / FOV / limits / panels, dragging hides the overlay. Test hook `__m3dMatch.screenOf`.

## 5. Key decisions and why
- **Offline, file://-safe viewers.** Chrome blocks ES-module imports from file://, so the copied viewers use `3d\vendor\three.bundle.js` (esbuild IIFE: three + OrbitControls + CSS2DRenderer,
  `window.__THREE_BUNDLE`) and their `import` lines are rewritten; originals in 07_scale untouched; a viewer needing another addon gives a build NOTE.
- **One model at a time; its viewer starts by itself**; selecting unloads the others (one WebGL context); leaving the tab unloads all.
- **Stage = viewer 60 % + photo panel 40 %** (stacked < 900 px). Framed (iframe < 1100 px) the COPY hides `#side` / `#right` / `#wideBtn` / `#reason`; Borth's only panel `#side` holds the
  CONTROLS (class `m3d-sidectl`) and is kept; Boscombe is a 3-column grid (`m3d-grid3`). Round 11: Hide / edge buttons on every viewer panel (state in sessionStorage `m3d-panels`, hook `__m3dPanels`).
- **Full screen** = `.m3d-stage` through the Fullscreen API with an Exit button + Esc and a CSS fallback; the page right panel (`.m3d-pics`) collapses (class `pics-off`).
- **Hash routing:** `#view/models3d[/<slug>|/all]`. **(i) primitive** `ReefInfo`. **Long text rule:** one line + ellipsis + (i) / appendix `<details>`.
- **Pictures are copied, not hotlinked** (common.md rule 6); reuse rights are not cleared (the page says so).
- **Evidence-verified curated text:** quotations <= 25 words, `ev` snippets must occur verbatim in the model's documents ("VERIFY FAIL" otherwise); numbers that depend on a model value are
  `{{tokens}}` so they follow model.js (nothing hard-codes -4.0 m CD for Mount Maunganui).
- **Caveats as data** (`models3d_caveats.json`, 47 rows + generated version rows), mandated rows per model checked in `check.py` (`must`).
- **Match this photo only for plan-view pictures with documented geometry; no oblique pictures** (Lior); the receiver is injected into the build COPIES (`inject_receiver`), never into 07_scale.
- **Versions: the page re-loads the live viewer** (section 6). **Combined scene shows each model's default version only.**
- **update_page.py never writes to 07_scale / 03_images / 02_research;** one rolling page backup; state file written only after a clean run.
- **compile_data.py skips `assets\images\`** (it used to move the 3D picture copies to QA\removed_assets on every run, forcing a 55 s re-encode; 39 MB of such copies are still in `QA\removed_assets`, safe to delete).

## 6. Outline / model versions - contract and implementation
**model.js contract**: `versions[]` {id, name (meaningful, with the edge definition), date, source_ids[], method, level, kind (laser_survey|multibeam_survey|design_drawing|photo_trace|other),
area_m2, volume_m3, bbox_m, note, optional stated}, `default_version` (measured survey > design drawing > photo trace per Lior), `versions_info`. Real models: Borth `lidar_2022` (default, 8,675 m2, 31,336 m3),
`design_1020` (30,091 m3), `sat_2024` (26,400 m3); Mount Maunganui `multibeam_2013_m2p0` (default, 1,071 m2, 3,620 m3 at the default bed) and `asr_installed_toe_2008`.
**Viewer contract (corrected in round 11)**: viewers read `#version=<id>` at START (none of the real ones re-reads it later). The page therefore re-loads the live viewer with
`index.html?r=<time>#version=<id>&<its current hash>` (camera / water / VE live in the hash). A viewer that switches live announces `postMessage({type:"m3d-viewer-caps", handlesVersion:true})`
and then only gets `postMessage({type:"m3d-version"})` + a hash change (the synthetic test viewer does). Before this fix the buttons changed text and key numbers but NOT the 3D model
(the round-10 test used a synthetic viewer). QA now reads the viewer's own version `<select>` after each switch. On the page: header "Outline version" (button per version, (i) dialog,
"Showing:" line), shaded version rows in key numbers, generated caveat rows (origin "versions"). A photo match is cleared on a switch.

## 7. Checks and QA
- `check.py` "[3D]" block: section + viewer copy + poster per model; vendored three.js; gallery files; confidence / state / VE / key numbers / caveats / references; mandated caveat rows; curated
  evidence; versions contract; sticky nav; back bar; combined data and every export check; unreferenced assets (held slugs ignored); INFO sizes; then `dom_checks()`.
- `qa_models3d.py` 162 checks (2026-10-07 PASS): the 79 of round 10 (selector, hash, layout, panel, tooltip, lightbox, (i), full screen, navigation, combined scene, standalone bar, mobile) +
  `qa_round11.py` 83: combined labels do not overlap and stay inside the canvas, one scale bar (default / plan / overlay / 1000 x 700), Boscombe seabed reaches the beach; layout panel Hide / Layout;
  page panel + full-screen panels and state; every viewer's panel collapse; versions with Borth and Mount Maunganui incl. "really applied"; "Match this photo" UI per model and the corner-geometry
  test for all 30 pictures (overlay corners = picture corners projected by the viewer's camera, <= 3 px); no page errors.
- Screenshots `QA\round11_3d_*.png` (41, viewed downscaled): combined_oblique / plan / overlay / panel_hidden, fullscreen_panels_open / hidden, viewer_panel_hidden_borth, versions_borth_* /
  versions_mount_*, photomatch_<model> (6) and the round-10 set. `QA\round11_3d_versions_checks.txt` = synthetic versions test.
- Status log entry: `05_qa\00_STATUS.md` (2026-10-07, round 11).

## 9. File map (bulky files marked)
- `src\` see section 3. `data\models3d_{curated,caveats,combined,hold}.json`, `data\models3d_text\{methods,combined_method}.md`: curated inputs. `data\photo_match.json` (generated, ~60 KB, readable),
  `data\update_state.json` (generated), `data\models3d.json` (~1 MB, do not open), `data\images_manifest.json`, `3d\combined\*.js` (do not open), `3d\vendor\` (do not open), `3d\<slug>\` and `assets\images\` (generated, never edit).
- `UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` (how to bring in model updates), `QA\round11_3d_LOG.md` (step log + checkpoint), `QA\round11_3d_checks.txt`, `QA\build_check.txt` (latest check report), `QA\build_log.txt` (latest build output),
  `QA\prev\{round9,round10,last_update}\`, `QA\removed_assets\` (39 MB of old picture copies, deletable).

## 10. Open issues, discrepancies, requests for Lior
1. Pictures are private research copies; reuse rights are NOT cleared - resolve each registry rights_note before any public release.
2. **Pending model updates (come in with `update_page.py`, see UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md):** Mount Maunganui bed (default -3.6 m CD, later -2.8; the bed is an ASSUMPTION until the 2007 survey; all bed numbers are tokens);
   Borth offshore fix (seabed beyond 335 m is 0.89 m deeper than the Fig 2 -4.0 m contour; the 0.89 figure is typed in the caveat row and key number, update by hand); Boscombe flattening (offshore alongshore tilt, HANDOFF open issue 1 of that model).
3. Borth: oval length 38 m (drawing 1020) vs 46 m (1023) unresolved; volumes LiDAR 31,336 / design 30,091 / photo 26,400 m3; tide slider LAT..MHWS (HAT not found); the oval is a BREAKWATER, not a surf reef.
4. A viewer that imports a three.js addon outside the bundle shows a build NOTE and will not run until the bundle is extended.
5. The first-load Google Fonts request fails offline (falls back to system fonts). The viewers need WebGL.
6. Match-photo limits: Palm Beach text labels are drawn at world size and look huge in the 1.5 km Palm s4 view; pictures matched through a schematic icon (Palm s4) are only as good as the icon;
   Navionics screenshots are placed from the capture log, the chart's own positional accuracy is not assessed; Bunbury / Prattes Navionics have no geo.
7. With seven reef buttons the selector row wraps at 1440 px and the stage starts lower (full-screen button below the fold at 900 px high).
8. Combined scene: each shoreline is its own fitted waterline; only default outline versions are shown; patches differ in size and data quality.
9. Lior should look at the tab once in his own browser (tuned in headless Chrome at 1440 x 900 / 1000 x 700 / 390 x 844); `check.py` `must` rows are hard-coded per model.

## 11. What the comparison means (for readers of the page)
Same scale and same MSL zero for all reefs, one depth-colour ramp, one VE slider. NOT comparable without care: absolute offshore distance (each shoreline is its own fitted line), seabed
quality, and reef shape fidelity (surveyed vs idealised). The label of each reef carries its 3D confidence; a LOW reef is drawn like a HIGH one.

## 12. Next steps for the later full-build agent (build_shapes_videos.md), in order
1. Read `_agent_briefs/build_shapes_videos.md` and this file only; do not re-read src\. Run `python src\update_page.py --fast` first to see the baseline.
2. Shapes tab replacing the Scale tab (mega figure, confidence filters, Shape check viewer, comparison table, outline versions toggle + (i) from shape.json `outline_versions` / `default_outline` /
   `versions_info`): reuse the version UI of models3d.js (versionBarHTML, openVerDlg), the (i) primitive and `data\photo_match.json` (pixel -> canonical transforms of the traced pictures).
3. Videos tab (review tool, 02_research\videos, media_decisions.json) and the Images tab / reef-dialog gallery from the registry (reuse `prepare_image` and `assets\images\`; the 3D tab prunes
   `assets\images\<slug>\` to the pictures it shows: an Images tab must register its own copies in the same naming or extend `_keep` in compile_models3d.main).
4. Top-level "Methods" tab (07_scale\METHODS.md); per-reef METHOD/VERIFY rendering (reuse `render_md`, `md_sections`).
5. Reef dialog: embed the 3D viewer (lazy iframe, same markup/handlers as the tab - `viewerHTML`, `load`, `unload`; MAX_LIVE shared!) + "Shape check".
6. Add routes to the app.js hash regexes the same way as `models3d`; keep the sticky nav; keep the 3D block in check.py; keep every vN of the QA screenshots.
7. Keep this file current (edit, do not append); add a section per new tab; append to `05_qa\00_STATUS.md`; model updates always through `update_page.py`.
