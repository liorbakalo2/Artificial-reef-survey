# Cross-shore profiles of the reefs - SUMMARY

Generated 2026-10-15 by `08_paper/analysis/extract_profiles.py` (re-runnable) from the DEFAULT version of each 3D model in `07_scale/shapes/<slug>/3d/model.js` (read only). One JSON per reef with a 3D model: `08_paper/data/profiles/<slug>.json` (metadata, datum, shoreline definition, profiles every 1 m on two or three lines, metrics, sources, caveats); the four reefs without a 3D model: `08_paper/data/profiles/_no_3d_model.json`.

Every number for the nine modelled reefs is **DERIVED** from the model grids by the method stated here and in each JSON (not a new measurement). The inputs behind each model and their sources are cited in the JSON field `key_inputs` and in `07_scale/shapes/<slug>/3d/METHODS_3D.md`. The re-implemented reef surfaces reproduce the volumes stated by the models to within 1 % (JSON `reconstruction_check`). z = metres above MSL (each model's datum link is in the JSON field `datum`); y = offshore distance from the model shoreline y = 0 (defined differently per reef, see section 2).

## 1. Master table, all reefs (default version; crest-line profile)

Crest line = cross-shore line (constant model x) through the shallowest crest cell. Ramp = seaward face from the seaward edge of the crest zone (points within 0.10 m of the line maximum) to the seaward toe (last point where the reef is at least 0.10 m above the natural seabed). Mean slope = ramp drop / ramp length; max slope = steepest 2 m central difference on the ramp. Crest depth below MSL is negative where the crest is above MSL (Borth). "(cut)" = the model surface stops at its outline with more than 0.5 m of reef still standing, so the toe is not where the surface meets the seabed. Alongshore length = x-span of reef cells at or above the level: (a) -0.5 m MSL, (b) 0.5 m below the crest (the request "at crest -0.5 m" is ambiguous, both given).

| Reef | Version / basis | Crest z (m MSL) | Crest depth below MSL (m) | Crest height above bed (m) | Crest distance offshore (m) | Toe z reef / bed (m MSL) | Drop crest to toe, on reef / to bed (m) | Ramp length (m) | Mean seaward slope | Max seaward slope | Alongshore length (a) z>=-0.5 m / (b) z>=crest-0.5 m (m) |

For two-arm reefs (Cables, Mount Maunganui, Narrowneck, Prattes) the centreline passes through the apex block or the gap between the arms and the second crest line is the other arm; for single-body reefs the second crest line lies next to the centreline. See JSON `caveats`.

## 4. Alongshore extent of the reef above given levels (union length of x-columns, m)

Levels are metres above MSL; "-" = no reef cell that shallow. Borth counts the northern surf reef only (the southern oval is a shore-parallel breakwater, reported separately in its JSON under `secondary_structure`). Both readings of "alongshore length at crest -0.5 m" are in each JSON: `global.alongshore_length_z_ge_minus0p5_m_msl` and `global.alongshore_length_z_ge_crest_minus0p5` (span and union).

## 5. Evidence layers and alternative surfaces (not the default; own crest line)

## 6. Reading guide and caveats common to all reefs

* **What is survey and what is a rule**: Cables (Nov 1999 sounding surface), Borth (2022 LiDAR DSM) and Mount Maunganui (rise inside the -2.0 m CD contour from the 2013 DEM) carry survey information; Boscombe (flat crest, 1:3 flanks), Prattes (constant 1.35 m stack, 1:1 flanks), Bunbury (spherical cap), Palm Beach (contour interpolation), Narrowneck and Albany (design-surface rules) are idealised. Ramp lengths and slopes are model results and inherit these assumptions; the surfaces were not re-measured.
* **Seabed**: the natural seabed under each reef is interpolated (a pre-construction survey exists only for Cables, 1998). Mount Maunganui uses an ASSUMED as-built bed of -3.6 m CD; Palm Beach and Narrowneck rely on Navionics/multibeam with datum assumptions. Crest HEIGHT and ramp slopes depend on these; crest LEVEL is sourced for Mount Maunganui, Boscombe, Palm Beach, Prattes and Albany (design or stated values), surveyed for Cables and Borth.
* **Slopes are along the model y axis** (the cross-shore direction of the model frame). For oblique ridges (Albany, Boscombe, Borth boot) the slope normal to the crest differs; for Cables the frame axis is about 17.5 deg off the shore normal.
* **Tidal planes** (m above MSL, small-tide sites): JSON field `tidal_planes_m_above_msl`.
* **JSON layout**: `lines.<name>.profile.{offshore_m, seabed_msl_m, reef_msl_m}` are equal-length arrays at 1 m spacing (`null` = no reef / no data); `lines.<name>.metrics` are the numbers above; `global` holds crest, footprint and alongshore extents; `extra_layers` holds the evidence layers; `reconstruction_check` the volume test.
