# Appendix A. Methods and sources for the individual reefs

## A.0 Common workflow

The same workflow was applied to all 13 reefs. It has six steps, and every step leaves a written record that can be traced from the numbers in the tables (Appendix C) back to the source.

**1. Sources.** For each reef the published design and monitoring papers, official reports, survey data sets, georeferenced aerial and satellite images, press articles and the pages of reef-specific websites were collected. Each item was recorded with its full citation, link, licence, access date, what it shows and how it was used. Every number in the dataset carries a source, the place where it was read (page, table, figure or file), the method used, and a status: sourced (read in a source), derived (computed in this study), assumed (an assumption, flagged A1, A2, and so on in the sections below) or unknown (Appendix C). Values from secondary compilations whose cited sources could not be fetched and confirmed were not used.

**2. Plan shape.** The outline of each reef was traced on the best available image, in a fixed order of preference: a measured survey (laser or multibeam) of the structure, then a design or construction drawing of the built version, then a photograph. Satellite images (Esri World Imagery and dated Esri Wayback releases) were georeferenced from their Web-Mercator tile bounds. Drawings and figures were scaled from a printed scale bar or a known dimension and placed by fitting to an image or a survey. Each outline was checked on a second, independent image or raster (overlap measured as intersection over union) and against the dimensions given in the text. Where more than one edge is defensible, the other outlines are kept as named, dated versions. Each outline is expressed in a local frame in metres (origin at the shoreline point nearest the centroid, x alongshore, y offshore), with the shoreline bearing from the same image. Confidence follows a fixed rubric: high if the structure is clearly visible on a georeferenced image or an as-built survey and the dimensions agree with the text to about 10 %; medium if the trace is on a scaled design drawing, only part of the structure is visible, or the dimensions differ by 10 to 25 %; low if no image of the structure exists and the shape is inferred from text or a sketch.

**3. Three-dimensional reconstruction.** A model was built only where the plan, the crest level and the seabed depth are each sourced. The seabed is taken from the best measured data (single-beam soundings, airborne lidar, multibeam read from a published figure, a coastal digital elevation model) and otherwise from a chart (Garmin Navionics SonarChart read in a web browser, datum tested; Garmin Navionics, n.d.) or from design contours. The reef surface is either the surveyed surface or a loft from the crest level, over the traced toe outline, down to the seabed; its volume is a mound envelope (voids included) and is not the fill volume. All heights are brought to mean sea level (z = 0 at MSL) through an explicit datum chain (Appendix C, note 1). Only local tidal planes of the nearest standard port are used. A model with an invented platform height or bed would look like data; where the three inputs are not all sourced (Burkitts, Opunake, Kovalam, Xala) no model was built.

**4. Derived quantities.** The depth profile was taken on the shore-normal transect through the shallowest crest cell. The depth gap is the seabed depth at the toe minus the crest depth, the ramp length is the horizontal toe-to-crest distance, and the mean slope is their ratio (definitions and sensitivities in Appendix C, note 2).

**5. Documentation.** For every reef the assumptions (numbered A1, A2, ... with their effect on the result), the decisions (D1, D2, ..., with who decided and why), the validation against independent values, the confidence per element and the unknowns, with what would resolve them, are written in a methods file next to the model. This appendix condenses those files.

**6. Tools.** Image analysis used threshold and morphological operations, normalised cross-correlation and phase correlation for image registration, distance transforms for lofted surfaces, and piecewise-cubic interpolation for seabed profiles (Python with NumPy, SciPy, Shapely, pyproj and PyMuPDF). The decisions taken by the author are marked D below (see Section 2.6 on the tools used). Readings of values from figures are by eye or by calibrated colour or tick scales, and carry the stated reading error.

Table A1 summarises the status of the 13 reefs. Three-dimensional previews of the models are shown in Appendix B.

**Table A1. Plan outline, data used for the reconstruction, and confidence.** Plan confidence follows the rubric in step 2. "3D" gives the overall confidence of the three-dimensional model.

## A.1 Burkitts Reef, Bargara, Queensland (1997)

**Sources.** Burkitts Reef is a natural basalt headland platform at the south end of Bargara Beach. In February 1997 about 300 m^3^ of boulders (at least 12 large ones) were moved with an excavator at a cost of about AUD 10,000 (Rendle, 2016, Table 2.1; Howells & O'Neal, 2024; Raised Water Research, n.d.-b). No source gives a length, width, crest level or depth. The work zone of a later phase is shown on an annotated oblique aerial photograph (Jackson & Corbett, 2007, Fig. 1). The only georeferenced image is Esri World Imagery of 5 September 2025 (Esri et al., n.d.). Tidal planes of the nearest standard port, Burnett Heads, are from Maritime Safety Queensland (2026; MHWS 2.94 m, MSL 1.78 m, MLWS 0.61 m above LAT).

**Plan shape.** The visible platform was traced on the 2025 image (31,485 m^2^, a lower bound because the image frame cuts it). The later work zone was georeferenced with three control points on an Esri Wayback image of 31 July 2016 (an ellipse of about 1,750 m^2^, accuracy 20-30 m). The traced outline is the platform on which the reef sits and not the reef, because no source locates the 1997 works; the outline is therefore not used in the analysis (confidence low). The assumptions A1-A8 of the shape file are that the platform is the stage, that its edge is the breaker line at an unknown tide, and that nothing has changed since 1997.

**3D reconstruction.** Not built: crest level, platform height and seabed depth are all missing (the depths quoted for the dive site are site-wide ranges, not a profile).

**Unknown and what would resolve it.** The reshaped zone, the crest depth, the seabed and the tide at the time of the image; dated low-tide imagery with tide tables, a chart reading or a local account would resolve them.

## A.2 Cables Reef, Perth, Western Australia (1999)

**Sources.** The design plan of Lyons (1992) as reproduced in Blacka et al. (2013, Fig. A.2) gives the V-shaped outline with design levels (RL); the design study (Pattiaratchi, 1999) and the copies of the drawings on Raised Water Research (2019b) give the 45-degree peel angle, the 1:20 ramp and the proposed extension of the southern arm. The measured data are the single-beam soundings of the Western Australian Department of Transport (2020): a pre-construction survey ending 30 March 1998 (14,303 soundings in the window), and surveys of 22 November 1999 and 1 February 2002 (heights in m AHD). The Australian Height Datum (AHD) is defined by Roelse et al. (1975). Tidal range and mean level are from the Fremantle gauge about 4 km south of the reef.

**Plan shape.** The silhouette of the drawn structure (111 vertices) was scaled from four printed dimensions (6.51 px per metre, sd 0.05). Its position and rotation (9.74 degrees) were found by maximising the share of 1999 rock soundings inside the outline minus the share of bed soundings inside it: 91.0 % of rock and 18.5 % of bed soundings lie inside. With the scale also free, the optimum scale was within 2 % of the drawing scale. The outline coincides with the dark rock patch on four Esri images. Its size (121 by 76 m, 4,049 m^2^) differs from the text (140 by 70 m) by -13 % and +9 % (confidence high; extension version 4,355 m^2^, unconfirmed).

**3D reconstruction.** The seabed is the 1998 survey averaged per metre and interpolated, outside the reef the DoT composite grid shifted by +0.085 m, smoothed with a 2 m Gaussian filter (bed at the anchor -3.68 m AHD, accuracy 0.3 m). The default rock surface is the thickness (sounding minus modelled bed) at the November 1999 soundings inside the footprint and a 6 m margin, interpolated linearly to a 0.5 m raster, with negative values set to zero and a 1 m Gaussian smoothing (the rule that a sounding more than 0.6 m above the 1998 bed is rock was used only to classify soundings for the georeference fit); volumes are 4,671 m^3^ (1999) and 5,219 m^3^ (2002) (accuracy 1,000 m^3^), against 3,500-5,500 m^3^ in the literature. Design-surface versions loft the printed contours.

**Assumptions and decisions.** A1: the design RL is Fremantle low water datum, so z~AHD~ = RL - 0.716 m. A12: AHD is taken as MSL (local MSL 1992-2011 is 0.057 m higher). A5: side slopes of the design versions are linear over the drawn bands. A6: the extension is a pyramid scaled to 320 m^3^ (unconfirmed). A14-A17: the 1998 bed is the bed under the reef; soundings are rock-top depths, and interpolation between lines of about 5 m smooths boulder-scale relief. A7: high and low water are taken as MSL +-0.4 m.

**Confidence.** Plan high; seabed medium-high; surveyed rock surface medium; datum medium-high; tides low-medium (range and MSL measured, HAT and LAT not found); overall medium. The surveyed rock lies 0.13-0.22 m above the design ramp, which is not a datum effect.

**Unknown.** The extension, the rock surface after 2002 (a 2009 critique by A. Pitt, quoted by Raised Water Research, 2019b, puts the crest about 1.5 m below the lowest tide), HAT and LAT, and the sign of a 0.04 m Perth-zone height difference.

## A.3 Narrowneck Reef, Gold Coast, Queensland (1999-2000, renewed 2017-18)

**Sources.** The monitoring papers (Jackson et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2012), the renewal paper (Corbett et al., 2023), the sediment-pathway study (Vieira da Silva et al., 2021), the decade review (Mead & Borrero, 2011) and the NSW review (Blacka et al., 2013). The plan is traced on Esri Wayback release 9812 of 8 August 2020 (Esri et al., n.d.). The seabed is read from Fig. 3 of Corbett et al. (2023), a multibeam map of 2017 before the renewal, and from Garmin Navionics SonarChart labels. Tidal planes are from Maritime Safety Queensland (2026) for the Gold Coast Seaway; the asset polygon of the City of Gold Coast (n.d.; an envelope of 34,565 m^2^) was not used for the outline.

**Plan shape.** The visible containers were extracted by a threshold on the green channel, closing of 3.7 m and hand-checked polygons (7 polygons, 6,239 m^2^), georeferenced from the tile bounds (0.264 m per pixel; edge accuracy 1 m; waterline 15 m). Independent checks: a second tile set of November 2022 agrees to 0.2 m (phase correlation), images of 2016 and 2019 to 3-4 m by eye, and Navionics shoals to 7-25 m. The footprint is a lower bound because the deeper toe is not visible. Four more outlines are selectable: the Option 2 renewal design of 2017 (13,941 m^2^), the revised design of 2004 (13,631 m^2^), the relief zone of the 2011 survey (4,922 m^2^) and the Navionics 4.0 m shoals (537 m^2^). **Decision D7 (author, 10 October 2026):** the default is the 2020 photograph trace, because it is the only evidence of the state actually built (Option 2 was built only in part on the south reef) and no survey or drawing of the renewed reef exists.

**3D reconstruction.** The crest is the measured -2.2 m AHD of the 2018 multibeam (Vieira da Silva et al., 2021). The multibeam map of Corbett et al. (2023, Fig. 3) was converted from colour to depth with a linear fit through four tick labels of its colour bar (depth accuracy 0.4 m, position 10 m); the bed is a grey-scale opening (radius 4.65 m) and 6-pixel Gaussian smoothing of that raster, blended into an alongshore-uniform profile (seaward labels 7-10 m from Navionics; shoreward part assumed). The reef surface is the design surface (linear in distance rank between the -2.5 m crest loop and the -6 m envelope) lowered to the measured crest. Volumes are mound envelopes.

**Assumptions and decisions.** A1: the figure depths are m AHD. A3: the colour scale is linear. A4: the design surface between the contours is linear (offset +0.26 m, sd 0.66 m against 53 multibeam blocks). A6: Navionics depths are below LAT. A7: the nearshore bed (0-190 m) is a smooth monotone profile. A10: the datum link AHD = LAT + 0.760 m of Maritime Safety Queensland is used instead of the +1.00 m implied by the papers; this moves reef and bed by 0.24 m relative to the tidal planes (crest 1.44 m below LAT, or 1.20 m on the papers' rule) but does not change the geometry.

**Confidence.** Plan medium; crest medium-high; seabed in the window medium (seaward low-medium, nearshore low); reef height and slopes medium-low; tides medium-high; volume low-medium; overall medium.

**Unknown.** The renewed plan and survey (City of Gold Coast drawings, 2018-19 multibeam), the datum of the original multibeam, the nearshore bed, and the container-level shape.

## A.4 Pratte's Reef, El Segundo, California (2000-2001)

**Sources.** The design plan of Skelly Engineering (c. 2000), reproduced as Fig. 4 of Borrero and Nelsen (2003); the monitoring paper (Borrero & Nelsen, 2003) for the crest datum (apex "approximately -6 ft MLLW"), bag size, dates and the survey window of its Fig. 9; the NSW review (Blacka et al., 2013); the NOAA Santa Monica 1/3 arc-second coastal digital elevation model (NOAA National Geophysical Data Center, 2010) for the seabed; Navionics depth labels as a check; tidal datums from the NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (NOAA CO-OPS, 2026; Santa Monica, 11.7 km away, epoch 1983-2001).

**Plan shape.** The solid-outline bags of the design drawing (110 bags, 76 vertices) were traced and scaled from the printed bar (5.155 px per metre; agrees with the known bag size to 3-6 %); two reproductions agree in area to 1 %. The result (435 m^2^, 58.0 by 28.6 m) is a design layout, not an as-built plan; the 30 optional bags are excluded. Position: the centre of the survey window of the paper's Fig. 9 (33.92058 N, 118.43335 W, accuracy 150 m).

**3D reconstruction.** The Phase I reef follows the DEM seabed at a constant thickness of 1.349 m (one 1.2 m bag course) so that the apex face lies at -2.678 m MSL (-6 ft MLLW, z~MSL~ = z~MLLW~ - 0.849 m). The bed is the mean of 31 alongshore DEM profiles, checked against Navionics labels and the paper's profiles (agreement 0.3 m). Phase II and the removal in 2008 and 2010 are not modelled.

**Assumptions.** A2: the reef centroid is 91.44 m from the MSL waterline (+-25 m moves the bed by 0.78 m). A4: the 6 ft depth applies at the apex face, and the top follows the bed at constant thickness. A5: the bag-stack side slope is 1:1 (0.5-2.5), which is also the **assumed ramp and slope** in Appendix C. A9: the footprint is the design layout. A10: no settlement, scour or burial is modelled, although the real reef sank and was buried. A13: the position is the survey-window centre.

**Confidence.** Plan medium; datums high; seabed medium; stack height and slope low; overall **low** (design footprint, inferred position, assumed height and slope, and a height uncertainty of 0.85 m against a reef height of 1.35 m).

**Unknown.** The as-built footprint and bag layout, the crest elevation along the reef, the number of courses, and the true position.

## A.5 Mount Maunganui Reef, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand (2005-2008)

**Sources.** The council assessment of management options (Dahm & Gibberd, 2013), whose Fig. 3 is a multibeam survey of 18 July 2013, and Fig. 4 a survey of January 2007; the design papers (Mead & Black, 1999; Mead et al., 2007); Mead and Borrero (2011); the NSW review (Blacka et al., 2013); an ASR image of the completed reef in colour-coded depth (undated, after August 2008, datum not stated; ASR Ltd, via Raised Water Research, 2019c); aerial photographs of 2010-11 (Land Information New Zealand, 2010-2011) and Esri Wayback release 3630 of 15 January 2011; Navionics SonarChart of 2026; tide levels from Land Information New Zealand (LINZ, n.d.).

**Plan shape.** The default is the -2.0 m chart-datum (CD) contour of the 2013 survey (1,071 m^2^), digitised on the NZ-grid ticks of Fig. 3 (5.45 px per metre) and confirmed on a second raster (area 1,074 m^2^, intersection over union 0.93) and on the 0.125 m aerial (position within 2 m). The second version is the as-built toe outline of the ASR image (1,424 m^2^, scale +-6 %), corroborated by the as-built survey in Fig. 3 of Mead and Borrero (2011). The 2013 outline is five years after completion (apex bags deflated, base bags buried) and is a lower bound.

**3D reconstruction.** The reef is lofted from the traced outline to a crest at -0.9 m CD (z = -2.03 m relative to the present MSL, with MSL = CD + 1.13 m) over the 2026 Navionics seabed shifted to an as-built bed level of -3.6 m CD at the reef centre. The flank is 1:1 (default) or a linear loft from the toe (second version); the inner profile is the median rise curve of the 2013 digital elevation model scaled to the crest.

**Assumptions and decisions.** A6 and **decision D1 (author, 7 October 2026): the as-built bed at the reef is -3.6 m CD**, an assumption, because no source states the 2008-09 bed; every later source gives a bed 0.8-1.2 m shallower, and the stated built volume of 2,800 m^3^ is reproduced only with a bed of -3.51 to -3.66 m CD. A bed of -2.8 m CD would give a height of 1.9 m instead of 2.7 m (sensitivity: +-0.5 m is +-22 % in volume). A3: the crest is -0.9 m CD on every bag. A5: the 2026 seabed shape stands for 2008. A7: flank 1:1 (a run of 0.25-2 changes the volume from 2,567 to 3,421 m^3^). The scour hole behind the reef (to -4.9 m CD in 2013) is not modelled.

**Confidence.** Plan medium (default) and medium-low (toe version); crest medium-high; tides and datums high; seabed shape medium; **bed level and height low (assumed)**; volume low-medium; overall medium.

**Unknown.** The 2008-09 bed at the reef, the datum of the ASR image, a section drawing, and the as-built footprint (historical imagery of 2008-10 could provide it).

## A.6 Opunake Reef, South Taranaki, New Zealand (2006-2009)

**Sources.** The monitoring report of the regional council (Taranaki Regional Council, 2009), with the coordinates of Coastal Permit 6376-1 (31 May 2005) in its Appendix I and an aerial photograph in its Fig. 1; the NSW review (Blacka et al., 2013, Tables 4.2-4.4); Mead and Borrero (2011); a magazine article (Moores, 2006); a newspaper report (The Daily News, 2004); a news feature (Reid & Sumner, 2021); and aerial photographs of 2011-12 (Land Information New Zealand, 2011-2012), which show no structure.

**Plan shape.** The four published corner coordinates (a local circuit grid, corrected for one misprinted easting) form a rectangle of 189 by 94 m (17,726 m^2^), centred at 39.45943 S, 173.85163 E, georeferenced against Fig. 1 (residual 0.3 m, independent check 0.7 m). This is the **legal occupation area, not the reef**. The reef itself is described only by its design size (99 by 30 by 3.5 m, 4,900 m^3^; Taranaki Regional Council, 2009, p. 4). Where the reef lies inside the area is unknown (+-47 m along the axis, +-32 m across); the 99 by 30 m rectangle was assumed to be centred and parallel (A7, A8) and is not shown. The earlier size "90 by 20 m" is the 2004 concept quoted in The Daily News (2004) and repeated by later articles.

**3D reconstruction.** Not built: no bag layout, no per-bag crest levels and no surveyed seabed exist. Depths are known only below chart datum (LAT): the shallowest contour is at 0.0 m and the seabed is 1.8-3.0 m below chart datum (Taranaki Regional Council, 2009, pp. 3-4); an MSL conversion needs the LINZ standard-port levels and was not made. The as-built survey required by the consent within 90 days of completion is held by the council.

**Confidence.** Position of the occupation area medium-high; reef shape low (envelope only).

## A.7 Boscombe Surf Reef, Dorset, United Kingdom (2008-2009)

**Sources.** The design paper (Mead et al., 2010), the evaluation of the damaged reef with a DGPS bathymetry of April 2011 in its Fig. 9 (Rendle & Davidson, 2012), the doctoral thesis (Rendle, 2016), Mead and Borrero (2011), the NSW review (Blacka et al., 2013), Esri Wayback release 10 of 28 September 2011, beach profiles of 20 April 2010 (Channel Coastal Observatory, 2026b), the chart-datum offset of Bournemouth (National Tidal and Sea Level Facility, n.d.), and Garmin Navionics for validation.

**Plan shape.** The bag field is clearly visible on the 2011 image and was traced (4,042 m^2^, 88.5 by 94.3 m), agreeing with the April 2011 survey zones and with the designers' own plan. The area is about 40 % of the roughly 1 ha repeated in the literature (confidence medium). The outline is of the state after the damage of March-April 2011; the 2009 edge may differ by a few metres on the damaged offshore half.

**3D reconstruction.** The as-built state of 2009 is an idealised two-layer loft over the outline: a flat crest at the designers' +0.5 m above chart datum, 1:3 flanks, and a 1 m relief at the outline. The seabed is read from Fig. 9 (accuracy 0.2 m), with the beach from the measured 2010 profiles, and spline or EMODnet slopes beyond the survey. Heights are referred to MSL with z~MSL~ = z~ACD~ - 1.40 m; tide levels are from the gauge table of the design paper. Sixteen Navionics soundings agree with the model seabed (mean difference +0.06 m, sd 0.49 m), and its shoal areas match the survey zones to 1-2 %.

**Assumptions.** A3: the zero of the survey plot is chart datum (if it were Ordnance Datum all absolute heights shift by 1.4 m, with relief and volume unchanged). A6: the built crest is flat at +0.5 m ACD (+-0.3 m is +-4 % in volume). A7: flanks are 1:3 (1:2 or 1:4 change the volume by +8 % and -7 %); this flank is the **assumed slope** behind the ramp of Appendix C. A8: the seabed under the reef is a spline of its surroundings. A12: the 54 containers are not modelled individually.

**Confidence.** Plan medium; seabed medium-high (measured, +-0.2 m); crest medium (designer value, checked against October 2009 profiles); datum assumption strongly supported but not stated by the authors; overall medium.

**Unknown.** The datum of the Fig. 9 plot (to be confirmed from the thesis or from survey metadata), the as-built plan (a 2009-10 aerial image), and the crest height along the whole reef.

## A.8 Kovalam Reef, Kerala, India (2009-2010)

**Sources.** The ASR Ltd oblique aerial photograph of the completed reef from the lighthouse end (reproduced in Blacka et al., 2013, Fig. 4.5, where it is credited to ASR Ltd), a second oblique photograph with a hand-drawn break line (Raised Water Research, n.d.-c), Esri Wayback release 10 of 28 February 2011 for the shoreline, the NSW review tables (Blacka et al., 2013, Tables 4.2-4.4, pp. 66-70), Mead and Borrero (2011, Section 3.1.7) and a report by a surfer (Collins, 2010).

**Plan shape.** The five or six sand-container strips were traced in photograph pixels. Because the photograph has no scale and the camera height is not fixed, a camera model was fitted to the 2011 swash line (residual 2.2-2.8 px for heights of 30-80 m). The metric outline is therefore a family: 640 m^2^ (35 m), 1,216 m^2^ (60 m, the default) and 1,681 m^2^ (80 m). The alongshore length agrees with a secondary table (65 m), but the cross-shore size does not (41 m against 85 m). Confidence low; the shape is hidden in the survey figures.

**3D reconstruction.** Not built: the sources give only a crest submergence range (0.2-3.4 m, datum not stated, not tied to a position), a water depth range of 1.3-3.7 m and a tide range of about 1 m, with no profile, contour or datum, and the reef later sank, so no as-built survey exists.

**Unknown.** The true size and position, crest and seabed depth, and tidal planes. A navigation-chart reading, historical commercial imagery for February 2010 to 2012, or the designers' original design report would resolve these.

## A.9 Borth reef, Ceredigion, Wales (2011-2012)

**Sources.** The Phase 1 construction drawings 9V5090/1020-1023 and 1001, rev C1 of January 2011 (Haskoning UK, 2011), with plan rings, 15 setting-out points on the Ordnance Survey grid, crest levels, layer thicknesses and slopes; the laser survey (Welsh Government, 2022; 1 m DSM and DTM, flown 19 March 2022); Esri imagery of 2012-2024; the physical-modelling paper with the pre-construction contours (Rigden et al., 2013, Fig. 2); the tide table of the shoreline management plan (Royal HaskoningDHV, 2011); EMODnet bathymetry (EMODnet Bathymetry Consortium, 2024); a trade-press article for the rock quantities (Hansford, 2011); the national heritage record (Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales [RCAHMW], 2020).

**Plan shape.** Two mounds, a northern boot-shaped surf reef and a southern oval **shore-parallel breakwater** (not a surf reef), are bare rock on four dated Esri images (2012-2024). The outlines agree with the georeferenced design plan in position (0.3-4 m), orientation (1-3 degrees) and length (-4 % north, +0.4 % south). Three outlines are selectable: the **laser-survey edge (default, chosen by the author on 6 October 2026; 8,675 m^2^)**, the design rock-layer foot (6,989 m^2^) and the visible rock edge in the photograph of 17 September 2024 (5,743 m^2^, used for the plan area in Appendix C). The OS-grid to local-frame transformation has a residual of 0.005 m; the absolute position is limited by the datum transformation (2-5 m).

**3D reconstruction.** The surface is the 1 m LiDAR surface above the exposed level (about -2.3 mODN) plus the design toe berm and blanket of the sections below it. The seabed is the design bed level under the rock (about -4.0 mODN, "bed levels vary"), the hand-read -3.0 and -4.0 mODN contours of the physical-modelling figure around it, and an EMODnet gradient of -1.1 % beyond the contours. The model rock volume is 30,119 m^3^ (51,200 t at an assumed 1.7 t m^-3^, +-15 %). Heights: z~MSL~ = z~ODN~ - 0.31 m; the tide slider stops at MHWS (+2.56 mODN), because HAT of Aberystwyth was not found at a primary source.

**Assumptions and decisions.** A2: MSL = +0.31 mODN, the mean of the four tidal planes (+-0.15 m). A3: LAT = -2.44 mODN. A4: the LiDAR datum is ODN. D6 (7 October 2026): the -4.0 mODN contour of the physical-modelling figure became a control after the seabed seaward of the reef was found to be 0.89 m deeper than that contour. Beyond y = 335 m the model is 0.7-1.2 m deeper than the EMODnet cells.

**Confidence.** Plan high; crest levels high (design drawing, LiDAR and section drawings agree within 0.3 m); tide offsets medium; seabed medium-low (the bed level under the rock is the first-order unknown for height and volume); overall medium.

**Unknown.** The bed under the rock (no survey), HAT, the LiDAR datum (+-0.15 m on the crest), and any reef-only rock quantity.

## A.10 Palm Beach Reef, Gold Coast, Queensland (2019)

**Sources.** The asset polygon of the City of Gold Coast (City of Gold Coast, n.d.; boulder reef, 160 by 80 m, 11,942 m^2^), Esri World Imagery of 1 December 2025, a vertical Nearmap aerial with survey contour lines and a 0-25-50 m scale bar (Bluecoast Consulting Engineers, n.d.), the concept design (Mortensen et al., 2015), the project paper with the final multibeam survey as an oblique image (Hunt et al., 2022, Fig. 4), Garmin Navionics SonarChart, and tidal planes of Maritime Safety Queensland (2026).

**Plan shape.** The outer contour of the aerial (toe outline) was traced and placed by the north arrow and scale bar; it matches the City polygon to 0.55 m (11,972 against 11,942 m^2^) and an independent drawing of the same ICCE paper (about 45 degrees to the shore). The crest slot (59.2 by 5.9 m) is the innermost contour. Confidence high.

**3D reconstruction.** The ten unlabelled contour lines of the aerial were taken as the surveyed rock surface at an assumed interval of 0.5 m (a Navionics-derived interval of 0.46 m supports this), and the seabed as a smooth surface through the Navionics iso-lines outside 25 m of the reef and the toe elevations. The crest is at -1.5 m MSL (four sources). The two inferences agree to 0.27 m on average (sd 0.55 m, 427 points); no surveyed depth value was read.

**Assumptions.** A3: the contour interval is 0.5 m. A5: Navionics depths are below LAT and not tide corrected (LAT tested best, MSL rejected). A6: the natural seabed is smooth between iso-lines. A8: one rock surface with voids included. A12: the aerial lines show the as-built surface. A13: the Navionics seabed represents the 2019 bed. A10 and A11: the tidal planes of the Gold Coast Seaway apply (20 minutes earlier), with AHD 0.12 m below MSL.

**Confidence.** Plan high; crest level high; seabed and reef height +-0.5 m; overall medium. The City's asset register (height 5 m, volume 33,000 m^3^, units unknown) describes a reef 20-33 % larger than the model (crest height 3.9 m, envelope about 22,000 m^3^); the discrepancy is unresolved.

**Unknown.** A surveyed as-built seabed or crest value, the datum of Navionics, the interval and date of the aerial contours, and the units of the register entries.

## A.11 Bunbury Airwave, Western Australia (December 2019)

**Sources.** A news report (ABC News, 2019), the developer's account in the local press (Bunbury Mail, 2022), a spoken interview with the founder (T. Bottegal, Airwave founder, pers. comm., 8 October 2026; an interested party), a drone photograph (Raised Water Research, 2019a) and a pre-installation plan graphic (Raised Water Research, n.d.-a), a video frame of the installation (ABC News, 2019), the airborne lidar of 2009 (Western Australia Department of Transport, 2009; 10 m cells, vertical datum AHD), Garmin Navionics SonarChart contours counted in a browser, and the tidal planes of the Port of Bunbury (GHD, 2021).

**Plan shape.** The bladder is a circle of 12 m diameter, traced with 29 vertices on a near-nadir drone photograph (112 m^2^); a second video frame and the plan graphic agree. Neither image has a scale or a georeference, so the size comes from the stated diameter and the position (centre 37.5 m from the waterline, text range 30-45 m) from the text. The coordinates are an estimated centre (assumed). Confidence medium.

**3D reconstruction.** A symmetric spherical cap of height 2.0 m (range 1.6-2.0 m, volume 93-117 m^3^) stands in for the real surface, on the lidar seabed (bilinear, resampled to 5 m). Lidar and Navionics agree (RMS 0.32 m once Navionics depths are read below LAT). The seabed in the text ("about 1 m under the surface at low tide") and the lidar agree to 0.22-0.62 m.

**Assumptions.** A2: the 2009 0 m AHD contour is the zero of "distance offshore" (+-10 m is +-0.41 m of seabed depth). A4: height 2.0 m. A5: spherical cap. A6: "low tide" is MLLW. A8: the 2009 seabed is unchanged in 2019 (sd 0.30 m, a judgement). A10: the lidar datum is AHD and its uncertainty layer (0.47 m) is one standard deviation. A11: Navionics datum is LAT with a 0.5 m interval.

**Confidence.** Seabed sourced and independently supported; tides sourced and cross-checked (0.03 m); surface shape assumed; overall medium. The verdict "failed" rests on all dated 2019 reports; the developer's page dates the trial to 2018 and calls it not a failure, a claim contradicted by the dated reports.

**Unknown.** The as-installed surface (which flank was steep, fill level, the torn quadrant), the exact position, seabed change since 2009, and any rideable-wave record.

## A.12 Southern Ocean Surf Reef, Albany, Western Australia (2025)

**Sources.** Esri World Imagery of 20 January 2026 (the reef is a dark wedge, absent on 16 January 2025) and Esri Wayback release 13192 (Esri et al., n.d.); the Bluecoast final-design plan with contours, via Raised Water Research (n.d.-d), and the City of Albany design table (City of Albany, n.d.); the Option B plan with depth contours of Royal HaskoningDHV (2015, as reproduced by Raised Water Research, n.d.-d) for the seabed; the environmental impact assessment (BMT Western Australia, 2018) for soundings; tide predictions for Albany (Western Australia Department of Transport & Bureau of Meteorology, 2024); and construction reports (Sheil, 2026; Mercer, 2025).

**Plan shape.** The design outer contour (13,104 m^2^, 127 by 153 m) was scaled from its bar and placed on the 2026 image; the satellite-visible rock patch (10,918 m^2^) is the second version. The two outlines overlap by 81 %, with orientations within 3 degrees, and the length agrees with the City's 165 m (design plan 165 m, satellite outline 157 m). Confidence high. The default is the design outline, the volume of which (34,000 m^3^ on 2017 bathymetry) is stated by the City.

**3D reconstruction.** The seabed is one shore-normal profile read from the colour contours of the Option B plan along eight transects (the plan was georeferenced on four control points, residual 3-6 m; nodes -1 m at 36 m to -8 m at 330 m from the beach-face line), assumed alongshore uniform. The reef is lofted between a crest ridge, offset 9 m inside the shoreward edge and at -1.0 m AHD for the first 15 m, falling to -2.0 m at 40 m, and the toe outline: z = z~c~ + (z~b~ - z~c~)(d~c~/(d~c~ + d~t~))^N^, with slopes limited to 1:2. The exponent N = 2.73 is fitted so that the design outline holds 34,000 m^3^, so the volume is not an independent check. Rock mass uses 1.847 t m^-3^ (62,800 t / 34,000 m^3^).

**Assumptions.** A2: AHD is MSL (LAT is 0.74 m below AHD, from the mean of 1,043 predicted high and low waters of 2024). A4: the seabed is alongshore uniform. A6 and A7: the crest ridge offset and the crest levels (the City gives -1.0 m "shallowest" and 110 m at -2 m, but not where). A9: N is fitted. A10: bulk density. The datum of the 2015 contours is not stated and is taken as AHD; it conflicts with a 2018 sounding by 1.6 m near the shore.

**Confidence.** Plan high; crest medium-low (design values, no as-built survey); seabed low; pile height and slopes low (height known to about +-1 m); tides low-medium; overall **low**.

**Unknown.** The Bluecoast detailed design report with the 2017 bathymetry, the completion survey of 2025, and the rock movements of May 2025 and February 2026 (not modelled). Depth readings, or a survey by the Department of Transport (Middleton Bay), would fix seabed and heights.

## A.13 Xala Reef, Jalisco, Mexico (2025-2026)

**Sources.** An announcement by an industry website on 31 March 2026 (Indelicato, 2026), reporting a boulder reef designed by S. B. Mortensen (DHI Seaport), and a feature reporting "3,000 truckloads" of quarried boulders (Romeyn, 2025). The two images available show a surfer and a drone shot of a peeling wave; the rock reef is submerged and nothing is measurable.

**Plan shape and 3D.** Not traced and not modelled. No image of the structure, no scaled drawing, no dimension and no coordinate exist (the location was withheld until a reveal event billed for 16 April 2026), and an area pin found by the search is explicitly not the reef. A text-derived envelope of 160 by 80 m, placed 230-310 m offshore by analogy to Palm Beach Reef, exists in the project files but is not a measurement and was not used.

**Unknown.** All geometry, cost, contractor, construction dates (2025 or 2026) and performance.
