# Appendix E. Profile cuts and peel-angle geometry per reef

This appendix shows, on the plan of each reef, the lines that the quantitative sections rely on. Figure E1 draws them in the same plan frame and style as Figure 1 (shoreline at the bottom, seaward up, view looking seaward, plan shape of the default outline). Three kinds of line are drawn.

*The main profile cut* (black dashed line) is the line along which the two-dimensional cross-section of the three-dimensional model is read; it is the profile of Figure 1 and the basis of the ramp length, depth gap and slopes of Figures 4, 5 and 7 to 9. Where the reef has two arms, the cut runs along one of them (Narrowneck: the south arm; Mount Maunganui: the south, long arm), because the cut through the other arm clips the tip of the structure and does not cross the part where the wave is ridden. For Albany, Cables and Borth the author fixed the cut on 19 October 2026 (the decisions are listed in the next paragraph); for the other reefs the cut is the line through the shallowest crest cell (or the middle of the footprint) that comes closest to the crest depth of the master table (Appendix A). Every cut was sampled every 1 m on the model grid and runs perpendicular to the local shoreline, except where stated.

*Lior's cut decisions of 19 October 2026.* Albany: the automatic line (x = 48 m of the model frame) crosses the short, shallow take-off plateau at the offshore end of the reef, not the ridge that is surfed, so the main cut was moved to the middle of the long -2.0 m AHD ridge ("crest 110 m at -2 m AHD", `\cite{cityofnd}`{=latex}), at x = 17 m. Cables: the main cut passes through the centroid of the footprint and is perpendicular to the fitted 0 m AHD shoreline (offshore bearing 277.8°T), so it is 17.5° off the model's y axis. Borth: the cut at x = -43.5 m is 10 m south of the line of the earlier version of Figure 1; no source says where the Borth wave breaks, so the position is a judgement (Appendix A, section A.9). The first versions of these three profiles, which are no longer used, are described in the analysis notes of the repository.

*The second cut.* Figure 4 originally drew a second, hollow symbol for several reefs. A second cut is kept only where it has a clear physical meaning. Albany is the only such case: the main cut is the ride section along the long ridge, and the second cut (x = 48 m, red dotted line) passes through the take-off peak, the short and shallow part of the reef where the surfer catches the wave and which probably acts as a refraction and focusing element for the wave that then runs along the ridge (a reading of the design plan, not a measured fact; `\cite{royalhaskoningdhv2015}`{=latex}). The second cuts of Narrowneck (a cut through the north arm that clips the tip, ramp length 16 m) and Pratte's (a cut through the tip of the apex, ramp length 1 m) are artefacts of where the shallowest model cell happens to lie, and were dropped.

*The arm and the incident crest.* The peel angle of Figure 5 is built from the angle φ0 between the incident wave crest and the reef arm that the wave peels along (refracted to the break depth by Snell's law, Appendix A and Section 4). The arm is drawn as a solid black line at the true bearing of the arm axis given in the shape files of the reef (Appendix A); for Pratte's, where no bearing is available, the arm is the principal axis of each half of the V outline. The incident crest (blue dashed line, through each arm and through the arrow offshore of the reef) is perpendicular to the arrow, which gives the direction in which the waves are assumed to travel. φ0 is obtained in one of three ways, written beside each reef name in Figure E1 and in the tables below: *sourced* (Cables: the design peel angle of 45° between each arm and the wave crest; `\cite{pattiaratchi1999}`{=latex}; `\cite{lyons1992}`{=latex}, as cited by `\cite{mead2011}`{=latex}); *derived from a design drawing* (Pratte's: the arms are drawn at 44.7° and 44.4° to the axis that is the assumed wave direction; `\cite{skellyengineeringc2000}`{=latex}, as reproduced by `\cite{raisedwaterndf}`{=latex}; Boscombe: the reef axis against the crest of the 191° design swell, geometry only; `\cite{mead2010}`{=latex}); or *assumed* in red (Narrowneck, Mount Maunganui, Borth, Palm Beach, Albany: no incident direction is documented, so the swell is assumed to arrive parallel to the shoreline, that is the crest is parallel to the beach and φ0 is the angle between the arm and the shoreline). The assumption is the usual first guess (refraction turns a swell towards parallel to the shore), but it ignores any oblique approach and therefore probably overstates φ0 where the real swell is oblique (for example Narrowneck, where the dominant swell is from the south-east, `\cite{nettle2017}`{=latex}; with an assumed 49° obliquity φ0 would be 41°, the dashed variant of Figure 5).

![**Figure E1.** Profile cuts and peel-angle geometry of the nine modelled reefs, drawn on the plan of each reef in the style of Figure 1 (seaward up, shoreline at the bottom, view looking seaward; panels without a label are at the common scale, bar = 50 m; Pratte's (2×), Mount Maunganui (3×) and Bunbury (5×) are zoomed about the shoreline by the factor written at the top right of the panel, with their own bar, and Mount Maunganui has an axis break because the reef lies too far offshore to share the zoomed window with the shoreline). Black dashed line: the main profile cut, which is the section of Figure 1 and the cut used in Figures 4, 5 and 7 to 9. Red dotted line: the one second cut kept in Figure 4, Albany's take-off peak. Solid black lines: the reef arm or arms used for the peel angle φ0. The number beside each name is the peel angle φ0 between the assumed incident wave crest (not drawn) and the arm as used in Figure 5, in red where it is assumed and in grey where it is sourced from a design document or derived from a design drawing. Cables: the crest is the one that meets both arms at the same angle (43.5° as drawn, 45° as designed). Narrowneck: φ0 = 81.1° is the mean of the two arms, which are drawn at the measured 72.2° (north) and 90.0° (south). Bunbury has no arm: its cut passes through the centre of the 12 m dome and no peel angle was computed.](figures/figE_lines_per_reef.png){#fig:E1 width=100%}

Cut positions are given in the horizontal frame of the model of each reef (x alongshore, y offshore; Appendix A) and as the alongshore offset of the cut from the middle of the plan drawn in Figure E1 (positive: to the right when looking seaward). Bearings are true. The offshore (shore-normal) direction of the cut is the seaward bearing of the local shoreline normal.
