# SOURCE AUDIT 2026-10-10 - kovalam-reef-india (Kovalam Reef, Lighthouse Beach, Kerala)

Files audited: shape.json, FEASIBILITY.md, METHOD.md, VERIFY.md, sources.md, HANDOFF.md, rectify_result.json, registry `03_images/reefs/kovalam-reef-india/images.json`. No 3D (point 8 n/a). No model value changed.
Page status (Lior, 2026-10-10): HIDDEN. Mechanism: `07_scale/reefs/kovalam-reef-india.footprint.json` display:false with a reason (outside this folder, not edited). Reason / checks / assumptions now in FEASIBILITY.md and shape.json (`page_status`).
In this audit the papers in `papers/` were re-read at the cited places (PyMuPDF text layer) and WebSearch was used for citations.

## 2. Statement-by-statement check (point 1)

| 6 | Camera at the lighthouse end looking NNW | Mead & Borrero s.4.1.4 (monitoring from the lighthouse viewing platform) + identification of the tombolo rock on sat2011 | METHOD 2 | camera fit starting point | ok; the fitted camera sits at the tombolo rock (8.38724 N 76.97608 E at H 34), not on the lighthouse platform: consistent only roughly (inference) |
| 7 | Horizon row 191 px; principal point (467, 360); zero roll | read on the photo | METHOD 3.2 | camera model | ok (reading), assumptions A2 |
| 8 | Fit: one basin H = 34 m, f = 1,045 px, rms 2.2 px; rms 2.2-2.8 px for H 30-80 m; footprint 546 m2 (H 30) to 1,681 m2 (H 80) | rectify_result.json H_sweep (re-read here: H30 546 m2 rms 2.39; H35 640 m2 rms 2.22; H80 1,681 per HANDOFF) | - | scale uncertainty | ok(script) |
| 9 | Default H = 60 m: area 1,216 m2 (59 x 41 m) | rectify_result.json `selected`; shoelace of shape.json polygon gives 1,217.2 | - | default outline | ok; mismatch of 1 m2 (canonical.area_m2 1,217 vs outline_versions 1,216): rounding, no action.

| 10 | H35 version: bbox 43 x 24 m (shape.json) vs sweep along 38 / cross 29 m (rectify_result.json, H = 35) | - | - | version list | mismatch (open): the two files give different extents for the same version; areas agree (640 / 641.5). Not changed; for main / next agent to check how bbox is defined (HANDOFF repeats 43 x 24) |
| 11 | Strips about 38 deg (+-15) to the swash line; swash bearing 196 deg | rectify_fit.py | - | description | ok(script) |
| 12 | Position +-20 m (swash points +-6 m, season 10-30 m) | VERIFY sensitivity; Mead & Borrero s.4.1.4 | - | uncertainty | ok |
| 13 | Reef later deflated and sank | card (RWR); WRL p.70 (E. Rendle pers. comm. 2013) | - | note only, not drawn | ok |

## 3. Methods (point 3)
Single-view camera fit (`rectify_fit.py`, ~4 min run): pinhole, zero roll, principal point at the photo centre, horizon row gives pitch for any focal length f (tan pitch = (360-191)/f); 250 random starts over camera position, height 25-120 m, azimuth, f; cost = nearest distance in pixels from 14 photo swash points to the satellite swash curve (11 points) projected through the camera. Each traced vertex is intersected with the sea plane z = 0 (t = H / -ray_z). Local metres about 8.3885 N 76.9745 E (111,320 cos(lat) and 110,574 m/deg); canonical frame by explicit rotation (geom.py make-canonical not used because of a known rotation bug). The photo does not fix H (rms flat); H is chosen by argument (A3). No AI tool; Gemini compared only.

## 4. Assumptions (point 4)
| id | assumption | why | effect | replaced by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | The sea surface is a plane at z = 0 and the strips lie on it | submerged reef, small relief | strips higher than 0 would lie nearer the camera: scale error of a few % | survey |
| A2 | Pinhole camera, zero roll, principal point at the photo centre, no lens distortion | photo has no EXIF/calibration | +-6 px horizon = area 1,177-1,251 m2 | calibrated photo |
| A3 | Camera height H = 60 m (default); 35 and 80 m kept as alternates | the photo cannot fix H (rms 2.2-2.8 px for 30-80 m); 60 m gives a normal 72 deg wide-angle lens and reproduces WRL's 90 m offshore. Circular: WRL's 90 m was used to choose H, so the agreement is not independent | area 640-1,681 m2 (x2.6) | vertical image, or a plan |
| A4 | The 2011-02-28 swash line represents the beach at the time of the photo (2010-11) | different dates; beach moves 10-30 m with season | position +-20 m | satellite from the photo date |
| A5 | The traced outline (strips + whitewater patch) is the reef; faint streaks right of the whitewater and the haze-covered tip are excluded or guessed | visibility | the real footprint is probably larger (4,000 m3 over 1,216 m2 = 3.3 m mean height; WRL 85 m cross-shore vs 41 m) | plan |
| A6 | The aerial shows the intact reef (before the deflation reported later) | photo before 2011-03 | none for that date | - |
| A7 | Swash line read by eye on a 2x view (+-10 view px = +-6 m) | resolution 1.18 m/px | +-6 m position | z19 tiles |

## 5. Decisions (point 5)
| id | decision | options | who / when | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Trace the ASR aerial (not satellite) | satellite / aerial | agent 2026-10-10 | reef not resolved from above |
| D2 | Camera-fit rectification instead of a guessed scale | eyeball / fit | agent 2026-10-10 | traceable method |
| D3 | Default H = 60 m, plus H35 and H80 as toggles | single outline / three | agent 2026-10-10 | scale undetermined |
| D4 | Earlier crescent draft (2026-09) rejected | - | agent | outlined the dark patch, not the strips |
| D5 | Shape HIDDEN on the page; 3D not built | draw with three outlines / hide | Lior 2026-10-10 (rule), applied through footprint.json display:false | scale unknown (area 546-1,681 m2) |
| D6 | Gemini not used | - | agent | unfetchable |

## 6. Confidence (point 6)
Plan: LOW (one oblique photo, scale free). Position: LOW-MEDIUM (+-20 m). Crest: NONE (0.2-3.4 m submergence is an unlocated range, no datum). Seabed: NONE (one range 1.3-3.7 m, no profile). Tides: LOW (range ~1.0 m, no levels). Volume: MEDIUM-LOW (4,000 vs 4,800 m3). Overall LOW; hidden.

## 7. Consistency (point 7)
Areas, scale, dates agree across shape.json, METHOD, VERIFY, HANDOFF. Mismatches: 9 (1 m2 rounding), 10 (H35 extent), 2 (4,000 vs 4,800 m3, card), 15-17 (fixed / flagged). Registry img-09 file name 2014 vs capture 2011 (known).

## 8. Counts
Statements checked 17; ok 12; fixed 3; mismatch 2 open (10, volume 2) + 1 rounding; missing 1 (confirmed URL/DOI of Mead & Borrero 2011); assumptions 7; decisions 6.
