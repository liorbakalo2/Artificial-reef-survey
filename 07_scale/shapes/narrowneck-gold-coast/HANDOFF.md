# HANDOFF - narrowneck-gold-coast (written 2026-10-06 by the resumed tracer; read this instead of re-reading the sources)

## !! VERIFIER CHECKPOINT 2026-10-07 (run stopped early for Lior's usage limit; read VERIFY.md section "CHECKPOINT" for everything below)
- shape.json is UNCHANGED (status "traced"); the verification is partly done, results in VERIFY.md. Scripts/outputs: verify_scripts\ (design_outline_2004, navionics_polys, fig5a_register). Corbett 2023 figures: src\gov\corbett2023_extracted\.
- NEW FACTS: (1) Renewal OPTION 2 (2017 modified design: crest -2.5 m AHD = -1.5 m LAT, 20 m seaward shift of crest, 5 deg rotation of the south reef, alongshore width 120 m) WAS BUILT (Corbett et al. 2023, PDF p.5 Sec 4.2.6); the north reef shape was almost fully achieved, the south reef and the bridge only partly (PDF p.3). A pre-works multibeam survey (Corbett Fig 3, 2017) exists but no post-renewal as-built plan/survey. (2) Our trace is CONFIRMED (frame, scale, canonical polygons recomputed to 0.3 mm; 2022 tile 0.2 m; shoreline 356.1-356.2). (3) The visible field is a LOWER BOUND: seaward edge is detector-limited, 20 faint dark patches (~540 m2) lie up to ~60 m beyond the N-arm tip (y 241-430 m), and the reef reaches ~10 m depth (Jackson & Corbett 2019). (4) Navionics: S-arm 4.5 m contour is an OPEN U-shape (not a closed loop); chart 4.0 m shoals are only 138 m2 (N) and 399 m2 (S): indicative only, NOT a footprint. (5) Channel objects 1-3 persist in 2019/2020/2022 imagery; they are 2 m wide, so "probably containers". (6) 2004 design placed in the frame: outer -6.0 contour 13,631 m2, 94.5 % of the trace inside; crest loops 60-62 m.
- DEFAULT OUTLINE (agreed with coordinator): the 2020 photo trace; toggles: 2004 revised design -6 m (pre-renewal), Navionics 4.0 m shoals (indicative), 2011 survey relief zone (Jackson 2012 Fig 5a, pre-renewal; to digitise), and probably Renewal Option 2 design (Corbett Fig 2; ask main whether Option 2 should outrank the photo).
- NOT DONE: shape.json fields (outline_versions etc.), overlays re-render, "3D inputs check", Gemini re-fetch, registry rows (incl. Corbett figures), REQUESTS_FOR_LIOR P1, STATUS entry. Exact ordered TO DO list: VERIFY.md "CHECKPOINT" -> "TO DO". Open discrepancy to resolve first: Corbett Fig 2 scale (50 m bar = 97 px) gives ~85-90 m crest loops vs 60-62 m from the Jackson Fig 7 chain.
- Superseded by the above: HANDOFF section 5 item 1 (renewal option unknown) and section 3b "closed 4.5 m loop over the south arm".

## 1. STATUS PER STAGE
| stage | status | date | confidence + reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| plan-shape TRACE | done, shape.json status "traced" | 2026-10-06 | MEDIUM: both arms resolve into individual 20 m containers on georeferenced 2020 imagery (edges +-1 m; confirmed on a second tile set to 0.2 m and by the Navionics shoal loops to ~20 m), arm length within 10 % of the design drawing; but the deeper toe (below ~6 m) is not visible, 3 channel containers are faint, and which renewal option was built is unverified |
| VERIFY | not done (next agent) | - | - |
| 3D model | not started; inputs prepared (METHOD.md "INPUTS FOR 3D", section 6 below) | 2026-10-06 | - |
| image registry | 53 rows (img-45..53 added today); check_registry.py PASSED | 2026-10-06 | 7 rows still pending for the 3D agent (section 5) |
| page (04_build) | not touched by this task | - | the page needs shape.json, overlays\ and the registry |

## 2. KEY DECISIONS AND WHY
1. STATE DRAWN = the RENEWED reef as left in June 2018 (84 containers added around the existing 2004 revised structure; the City: "minor changes to the shape", REPORT 6.2). Why: Lior's rule (model the latest as-built state; history goes in captions); post-renewal imagery shows the containers.
2. PRIMARY = Esri Wayback release 9812, capture 2020-08-08, z19 (s3, img-45). Why: sharpest post-June-2018 image. The other tile sets: 2019-06-18 (r21485, s5/img-47) blurred/blocky; 2021-04-17 == 2021-08-12 (byte-identical) blurred; 2022-11-06 == 2023-06-09 == 2025-04-27 (byte-identical; s4/img-46) dark but resolved; 2025-10-10 (s2/img-44) featureless; 2016-07-01 (s6/img-48) pre-renewal, murky. The identify date on repeated tile sets is only a lower bound.
3. OUTLINE = the VISIBLE container field (thresholded dark patches + closing radius 3.7 m), not a design contour. Why: the design outline is a prior and may be ~20 m off (unverified, Corbett 2023 snippets); the visible field is what exists. It ends at about the -6 m design contour; deeper toe invisible, so the footprint is a lower bound.
4. Design prior = Jackson et al. 2012 Fig 7 / Fig 6b (img-10 / img-09) georeferenced by chain: Fig 7 = 1.75 x Fig 6b (same photo); scale 0.21 m/px +-10 % (Jackson 2007 Fig 13 100 m bar = 4.275 px/m, img-27, plus dark-patch matching); placed on s3 by dark-patch NCC (corr 0.57, rotation 0.5 deg). Tolerance +-15 m at the ends (translation sensitivity: 12 m). Used only as a cross-check, never to move the polygons.
5. Shoreline frame: waterline of the 2020-08-08 image (z17, 285 rows) -> bearing 356.2 deg (north-heading); origin = waterline foot of the area-weighted centroid; +x alongshore (north), +y offshore (bearing 86.2). geom.py used as fixed 2026-10-05 (selftest 334/334); one point hand-checked (N arm vertex 0, s3 px (379,605) -> (41.399, 239.740) m by pixel algebra, by lat/lon, and by geom.py).
6. Naming: the three E-W shapes in the channel mouth are "channel containers", NOT "weir": the 2004 weir containers (Jackson 2012 Figs 4, 7) are drawn N-S across the channel 25-40 m seaward of them and are invisible in 2020 (lowered up to 2 m, largely buried, Jackson 2012 p.6).
7. Confidence level "medium" (not "high") because of decision 3 and the unverified renewal option.
8. Gemini rejected: two stacked "inshore/offshore lobes", 400 x 220 m, 75,000 m2 - no source supports them (METHOD Step 4).
9. Navionics: used as an independent POSITION check and seabed context; NOT used for the crest (chart smooths the reef to a 4.0-4.5 m shoal; the one crest-like value, a "0.9" spot depth, probably carries an older crest state).
10. Datum policy for crest values: carry +-0.25 m for the ICM rule (AHD = LAT - 1.00) vs MSQ (AHD = LAT + 0.760).

Lat/lon polygons: shape.json geo.polygons_latlon (same order). Pixel polygons: shape.json sources[s3].pixel_polygons and trace_s3_out.json.
### 3b. Cross-checks (numbers)
- s4 vs s3 phase correlation: 0.65 px E, -0.37 px (0.17 m E, 0.10 m N). s5/s6 by eye +-3-4 m.
- Council polygon OBJECTID 4637 (s1): in our frame 171 m alongshore x 262 m cross-shore, 34,565 m2 (attribute 34,409; LENGTH 256, WIDTH 151, HEIGHT 3, TOP_REDUCED_LEVEL -2.5, VOLUME 7,668 unreliable); contains 100 % of the traced area; traced area = 18 % of it.
- Design drawing scale: Jackson 2007 Fig 13 bar 100 m = 428 px (black segments 154-241 and 325-407 px = 20 m each): 4.275 px/m +-1 %. Design north-arm crest loop ~62 m, outer (-6 m) arm length ~121 m (traced 134 m, +10 %), channel wall ~33 m, tip-to-tip ~55 m.
- Design prior vs trace (canonical y, m): N arm design outer contour 217.2-354.1 vs traced 239.7-369.1; S arm 207.8-345.8 vs 230.3-341.7. Fig 7 -> s3 affine in design_registration_out.json and shape.json design_prior. Registration +-15 m.
- Navionics (img-50..53): SonarChart closed 4.0 m loop (+4.5 m loop) over the north arm; closed 4.5 m loop with a "0.9" obstruction label over the south arm; closed 6 m loop between the arms; 5.5-6 m contours around; 7-10 m seaward; 0.5 m labels; nearshore 0-2 m within ~100 m of the beach; restricted-area polygon ~118 x 140 m around both arms. Nautical layer: only spot depths 0.9 and 5.9 inside that polygon. Datum not stated by the app (assumed LAT). Trace laid on the chart (map centre = reef centroid, 0.5273 m/px) falls on the shoal loops within ~20 m.
- Visible container footprint is ~70-80 containers (80 m2 each) vs ~534 placed: most are stacked or deeper than the visible limit.
### 3c. Container facts (see REPORT 6.1-6.3 for pages)
20 m long, 3-4.5 m diameter, 408 placed Aug 1999 - Dec 2000 (Jackson 2007 p.4); ~450 by 2006: +10 (2002-03), +15 (2004: weir 2 + flared wings 2 + replacements), +17 (2006) (Jackson 2012 p.3, Fig 4 table p.4); +84 in the 2017-18 renewal "around the existing structure" (City of Gold Coast 2020 archived page); sand volume ~147 m3 per container (60,000 m3 / 408); settlement: weir containers lowered up to 2 m, now 1.5 m below design; flare containers 1-1.5 m (Jackson 2012 pp.6-7).

## 5. OPEN ISSUES, DISCREPANCIES, PENDING CHECKS, REQUESTS FOR LIOR
1. Which renewal option was built (Corbett, Mulcahy, Elliott-Perkins, Hunt 2023, Coasts & Ports; ResearchGate 403, Informit blocked): the "~20 m seaward" shift of Option 2 is unverified. Our trace-vs-design offsets (+15 m N tip, -4 m S tip, ~22 m shoreward) are inside the +-15 m registration tolerance, so neither confirmed nor excluded. Lior to open the paper (REPORT 8 request 1) or the City to supply the renewal drawings/multibeam (REPORT 8 request 2).
2. Deeper toe not visible: the footprint is the field to about -6 m. Seaward dark patches (3) are untraced; a 2025 State bathymetry lidar (REPORT 4) or the City's multibeam would settle the toe.
3. Identity of the three channel containers; the 2004 weir containers are not visible.
4. Crest datum: measured -2.2 m AHD = -1.44 LAT (MSQ 0.760) or -1.2 LAT (ICM 1.00 rule); target -2.5 AHD = -1.74 LAT (MSQ) or -1.5 LAT (ICM): carry +-0.25 m; ask the City for the offset used in the 2018 survey (REPORT 3 remark ii).
5. Navionics "0.9" spot depth (obstruction symbol, suffix unclear, datum unstated): ask Lior to read it in the app at -27.9866, 153.4341 (Navionics app: label, depth units, datum). It is 0.5 m shallower than the measured crest, probably an older state (2001-2012: ~1.0 m below LAT).
6. Registry rows still pending for the 3D agent: img-01 and img-04 (crest labels/datum, seabed), img-14 (stack height), img-24 (crest), img-31 (seabed/crest), img-50 and img-51 (Navionics crest/seabed). All other planform checks are written (pending false for 02, 03, 05, 08, 09, 10, 23, 26, 27, 36, 43).
7. Black & Mead (2001) JCR SI 29 pp.115-130 not opened (paywalled): crest "-0.67 m AHD" is known only via Vieira da Silva 2021.
8. Licences: Esri imagery, Garmin charts and the ICCE/Shore & Beach figures are private research copies; reuse rights to be checked before any public release (every registry row says so).
9. Fig 13 vs Fig 7 are not equally stretched (E-W ratio 1.10, N-S 1.22 between the two drawings): the design drawings are not metric to better than ~10 %.
10. geom.py's canonical origin lies outside the s3 crop (waterline is ~290 m west of the reef); this is intentional.

## 6. INPUTS FOR 3D (summary; the full table with sources and pages is the last section of METHOD.md)
State to model: renewed reef, June 2018. z = 0 at MSL.
- Plan: shape.json canonical.polygons_m (arms [0],[1]; wings [2],[3]; channel containers [4]-[6], two faint). Positions +-1 m; footprint = visible field (lower bound).
- Datums (Gold Coast Seaway, MSQ 2014 / 2026; REPORT 3): AHD = LAT + 0.760; MSL = LAT + 0.88; MHWS 1.53, MHWN 1.24, MLWN 0.51, MLWS 0.22, HAT 2.03 above LAT. With z=0 at MSL: LAT -0.88, AHD -0.12, MLWS -0.66, MLWN -0.37, MHWN +0.36, MHWS +0.65, HAT +1.15 m. z_MSL = z_AHD - 0.12 = z_LAT - 0.88.
- Crest: measured -2.2 m AHD (= -1.44 LAT = -2.32 MSL) after the 2018 renewal (Vieira da Silva 2021 AM p.5), +-0.2 m plus the 0.24 m datum ambiguity; target RL -2.5 m AHD = -1.5 m LAT (Jackson 2007 printed p.7; council TOP_REDUCED_LEVEL -2.5).
- Crest variation (design, 2004; Jackson 2012 Fig 2 right p.3 = img-04; Fig 13 img-27): -2.50 over the shoreward wedge (~60 m of each arm), -3.0 ... -6.0 deepening seaward, outer limit -8.0; settlement since then 1-2 m locally. Do not use a flat crest; do not model the 1998 split V.
- Seabed: Vieira da Silva 2021 Fig 3 (img-31, survey 19 Jul 2018, AHD): inner edge -4/-5, under the reef body -6 to -8, seaward -9/-10 (+-1 m); design reef between the -2 m and -10.4 m AHD contours. Navionics (LAT assumed): 4.0-4.5 over the arms, 5.5-6 around, 7-10 seaward, nearshore 0-2 m within ~100 m of the beach edge (img-50). AHD = -(depth LAT) - 0.76.
- Containers: 20 m x 3-4.5 m; two layers at the crest (T2 on 2 x T4, Jackson 2012 Fig 9 p.7, img-14); estimated height above seabed 2-3 m at the shoreward crest, 4-6 m at the toe (ESTIMATE from crest -2.2 and seabed -4/-5 and -6 to -8 AHD); ~534 containers (408 + 42 + 84).
- Orientation: shoreline 356.2 deg, shore normal 86.2 deg; north arrow = +x in the canonical frame (bearing 356.2).
- Caption material (history, not modelled): crest -1.0 AHD (Waikato), -0.67 AHD design, -1.5 AHD (-0.5 LAT) built 1999, -1.0 LAT 2001 top-up, lowered to -1.5 LAT / -2.5 AHD, measured -2.2 AHD after 2018; weir 2004; renewal 2017-18 (84 containers).

## 7. NEXT STEPS (in order)
1. VERIFIER: re-run trace_s3.py and design_registration.py (expect 71/51 vertices, bearing 356.21, corr 0.567); look at overlays\s3_primary_trace.png and design_prior_fig7_contours_on_s3.png (downscaled); spot-check three vertices and one canonical point; check shape.json fields against SHAPE_SPEC.md (it has all blocks; verification[] is empty for you to fill); decide whether "medium" confidence stands.
2. Close or ask: items 1 and 5 of section 5 (Corbett 2023; Navionics "0.9" label) - SendMessage to "main" if Lior can supply them.
3. 3D AGENT: build from shape.json + section 6; do the 7 pending registry rows (img-01, 04, 14, 24, 31, 50, 51) and write results into images.json; use Navionics only as a seabed cross-check; keep crest at -2.2 m AHD with the +-0.25 m datum note; model the crest wedge deepening seaward (do not use a flat crest); mark height/slopes "estimated".
4. PAGE (04_build): show shape.json (confidence medium + reason), overlays\s3_primary_trace.png, the design-prior overlay, and the registry gallery (img-45..53 are new).

## 8. SOURCE PAGE INDEX (the facts above, where they come from; REPORT.md sections 3 and 6 carry the quotes)
- Crest measured -2.2 m AHD after the 2018 top-up: Vieira da Silva et al. 2021, Coastal Eng. 171:104027, accepted manuscript p.5 (src\gov\...vieira_da_silva2021_coastal_engineering_accepted_manuscript_2021.pdf). Same passage: designed -0.67 m AHD (Black & Mead 2001), adopted -1.5 m AHD, lowered to -2.5 m AHD; envelope "200-350 m alongshore and 400-500 m cross-shore" (Jackson & Hornsey 2002).

## 9. GEMINI SOURCE VERDICTS (Gemini folder read-only; nothing from it used)
- Black & Mead 2001 JCR SI 29 pp.115-130 (title "Design of the Gold Coast reef for surfing, beach amenity and surfing aspects"): unverifiable (paywalled; bibliographic data confirmed by web search only).
- Jackson et al. 2012 (icce-ojs-tamu.tdl.org/icce/article/view/6956): wrong_design_version - the paper shows two alongshore-adjacent arms with channel, weir and flared wings, no inshore/offshore lobes, no 400 x 220 m.
- ICM case study / webinar (Salyer 2025): dimension_not_in_source (images only).
- Swellnet 2017-11-07: correct as a depth quote (2.5-2.6 m at low tide) but not a plan source; Gemini's crest 2.2 m equals Vieira 2021's measured -2.2 m AHD.
- Gemini's "180 m offshore" = the inshore lobe only (its own audit); ours: 212 m nearest edge, 288 m centroid.
