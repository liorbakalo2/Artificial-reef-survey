# SOURCE AUDIT 2026-10-10 - burkitts-reef-bargara (Burkitts Reef, "Greg's Reef", Bargara, Queensland)

Files audited: shape.json, FEASIBILITY.md, METHOD.md, VERIFY.md, sources.md, HANDOFF.md, registry `03_images/reefs/burkitts-reef-bargara/images.json`. No 3D (point 8 n/a). No model value changed.
Page status (Lior, 2026-10-10: shapes we do not know are not shown): HIDDEN. Mechanism: `07_scale/reefs/burkitts-reef-bargara.footprint.json` has `display:false` with a reason (not edited here, outside this folder). Reason, checks and assumptions are now written in FEASIBILITY.md and shape.json (`page_status`).
Status key: ok / ok(card) = from the reef card, not re-fetched / fixed / mismatch / missing.

## 2. Statement-by-statement check (point 1)
| # | statement | source | location | how used | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Greg Redgard moved ~300 m3 / ~12 boulders in Feb 1997 with an excavator | card R1, R3, R4 | card Dimensions row | context | ok(card). Card also records conflicting accounts of the duration (2 days vs "within weeks") and of the first application (1982, forum/database sources only) |
| 2 | Cost ~AUD 10,000 | card R1, R4, R8 (Swellnet comment 540429) | card Cost row | context | ok(card) |
| 3 | Tide swing ~2.5 m | card R4 only (RWR) | - | FEASIBILITY e. | ok(card), single weak source, no datum. A primary source exists but was not retrieved: Maritime Safety Queensland tidal planes for Burnett Heads (the nearest standard port) https://www.msq.qld.gov.au/_/media/tmronline/msqinternet/msqfiles/home/tides/tidal-planes/2026-semidiurnal-tidal-planes.pdf (URL from WebSearch 2026-10-10; Burnett Heads row not read). Added to REQUESTS_FOR_LIOR |
| 4 | Platform outline area 31,485 m2; bbox 321 E-W x 377 N-S m; perimeter 1,133 m; centroid -24.81574, 152.46750 | scripts/computed_v1.json; shoelace recomputed here | - | plan | ok (area), bbox/perimeter ok(script) |
| 5 | Area three ways 31,646 (pixel) / 31,485 (UTM) / 31,508 (geodesic) | VERIFY 4 | - | consistency | ok |
| 6 | Reef at about -24.8157, 152.4675; card lat/lon (24.8205, 152.4625) is Bargara town centre | card R11 (Wikipedia "Bargara, Queensland": 24 49 14 S 152 27 45 E); our trace | HANDOFF 3 | location | ok. mismatch for the card owner: card JSON stores lat as +24.8205 (north) although Bargara is at 24.8 deg SOUTH; and the point is the town, not the reef. Card not edited |
| 7 | Edge trends: east flank 160/340 deg; north-facing edge 107 deg | scripts/compute_shape.py | - | description only | ok(script) |
| 8 | Distance offshore 0 m | card R1, R2, R10 (headland attached to the beach) | - | frame | ok(card) |
| 9 | "Dive depth to ~9 m" is a depth at this reef | card R10 and card Ecology line say the dive site is "the same headland reef"; registry img-06/07 were REJECTED on 2026-09-25 because that dive video is at a marine-park reef that "shares the name" and is "not the rock-reshaped Bargara surf break" | card vs registry | FEASIBILITY d. | mismatch (open): the card and the registry disagree on whether the dive site is the surf platform. The 9 m figure is therefore NOT used as the platform's seabed (FEASIBILITY already says site-wide maximum, now also "may be a different site"). Card not edited; for main/card owner |
| 10 | "No later alteration reported since 1997" | absence of evidence in the card | design_version | state drawn | ok as an ASSUMPTION (A5); labelled |
| 11 | 1980 sketch date 7/9/1980 = 7 Sept | registry img-01 note: day/month order assumed Australian | - | context | ok, assumption A8 |
| 12 | sources.md says "Text sources behind numbers: card R1, R3/R4, R10"; shape.json references list only R1, R4, Esri | - | - | - | fixed: R3 and R10 added to shape.json references |
| 13 | Retrieval dates: Esri 2026-10-04 (sidecar `retrieved`), ABC sketch 2026-10-06 | sidecar, registry | - | - | ok |

## 3. Methods (point 3)
Pixel to geographic: linear in longitude, linear in Web-Mercator y between the sidecar bounds (`scripts/compute_shape.py`); then pyproj to UTM 56S for area and metres. Frame: north-up metres, origin = polygon centroid, +x east, +y north (no shoreline frame because the platform wraps a curved headland). Vertices read by eye; no smoothing, no interpolation of heights, no AI estimate used.

## 4. Assumptions (point 4)
| id | assumption | why | effect | replaced by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | The visible rock platform is the stage the reef sits on; the reef (reshaped boulder sub-zone) lies somewhere inside it | no source locates it | the outline is NOT the reef; reef area is unknown (300 m3 of boulders over 31,500 m2 shows it is a small part) | local account (Redgard, Bargara Boardriders), 1990s before/after aerials |
| A2 | The platform edge at image time is the outer edge of dark rock on the breaker line | breaking water marks the edge | tide state unknown: edge could move tens of metres | dated low-tide imagery + Burnett Heads tide at capture time |
| A3 | Landward edge = rock/vegetation or rock/sand boundary judged by eye | visible on image | +-5 m | LiDAR |
| A4 | North-up frame | curved headland | none (presentation) | - |
| A5 | No change to the platform since 1997 | none found in the card | unknown | 1997-98 and 2025 aerial comparison |
| A6 | Distance offshore = 0 (headland attached) | card R1/R2/R10 | none | - |
| A7 | Tide swing 2.5 m is typical; datum unknown | single RWR statement | none used in geometry | MSQ tidal planes Burnett Heads |
| A8 | Sketch date 7/9/1980 read day/month | Australian format | context only | the original |

## 5. Decisions (point 5)
| id | decision | options | who / when | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Trace the whole visible platform, not a sub-zone | platform / earlier 120 x 46 m estimate | agent, 2026-10-10 | the estimate cannot be reproduced; no source locates the sub-zone |
| D2 | One outline version, photo trace, default by necessity | - | agent, 2026-10-10 | no survey or design drawing exists |
| D3 | North-up frame | shoreline-aligned | agent | A4 |
| D4 | Polygon cut by the image frame at the south, kept | extend with a larger frame (needs network) | agent | area and bbox are minimums |
| D5 | Shape HIDDEN on the page; 3D not built | draw platform with a caveat / hide | Lior, 2026-10-10 (rule: shapes we do not know are not shown); applied via footprint.json display:false | the drawing would show the platform, not the reef |
| D6 | Gemini and the dive depth not used | - | agent | unverifiable; location mismatch (item 9) |

## 6. Confidence (point 6)
Platform outline: LOW (one image, truncated, tide-dependent edge). Reef zone: NONE. Crest: NONE. Seabed: NONE. Tides: LOW (one undated, datum-less figure). Volume: LOW (~300 m3 from news/spot sites, not a survey). Overall: LOW; page: hidden.

## 7. Consistency (point 7)
Areas, scale, dates agree across shape.json, METHOD, VERIFY, HANDOFF (items 4, 5, 13). Mismatches: 6 (card lat sign), 9 (dive-site identity), 12 (fixed). Status "verified" in shape.json is the same agent's self-check (VERIFY.md says so): the page rule hides it regardless.

## 8. Counts
Statements checked 13; ok 9; fixed 1; mismatch 2 (+1 fixed); missing 1 (primary tide levels); assumptions 8; decisions 6.

## 9. Image registry check (03_images/reefs/burkitts-reef-bargara/)
8 rows checked by script: every row has citation, image_url, source_page, page_or_figure, image_date, credit, license, retrieved, shows, how_used and file; every file exists on disk. Licences are "not cleared" private copies as recorded. IMAGES.md not rewritten.
