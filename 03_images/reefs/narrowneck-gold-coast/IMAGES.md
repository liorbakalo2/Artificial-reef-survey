- **3D / planform check result (2026-10-06)**: Planform checked 2026-10-06: Fig 2 right = 2004 revised design: two arms + central channel + flared wings at the shoreward ends (the 2004 revised design) = the topology of our trace (shape.json, s3 Esri 2020-08-08). The -2.50 m crest wedge covers only the shoreward ~60 m of each arm, contours -3.0 ... -6.0 deepen seaward (outer -8.0); the visible 2020 container field (113 x 157 m, arms 134 m and 111 m long) corresponds to the design out to about the -6 m contour. Crest -2.50 vs RL -2.5 m AHD adopted: consistent (Jackson 2007 p.7); datum of these labels still unstated here. STILL PENDING for the 3D agent: crest/datum and seabed only.
- **How used (update 2026-10-06)**: Planform result written by the Narrowneck tracer: topology and arm length agree with shape.json (METHOD.md Steps 2d, 3, 6).

Consistent in character with the traced wedge (134 x 54 m); qualitative only, which arm is not stated. Planform check done.
- **How used (update 2026-10-06)**: Qualitative shape check of the traced north arm (METHOD.md Step 6).

No planform contradiction; crest depth cannot be read from this photo. STILL PENDING for the 3D agent: crest-depth consistency only.

- **kind**: design_drawing
- **shows**: ICM construction-approval drawing of the original two-arm (split V) reef: plan view of the arms on the seabed contours inside a 750 m grid, an elevation profile along the reef axis (flat crest then slope to about -10 m at 580 m) and the double-peaked cross-section A-A.

The only published depth picture of the renewed reef's seabed; the survey is single-beam (not multibeam) and the reef is blurred.
- **3D check pending**: YES - Seabed around the reef and crest/toe depths: inner edge about -4/-5 m and reef body -6 to -8 m AHD (+-1 m, read by eye); compare with the tracer's/3D model's depth if one is built (values: seabed, crest_z)

The question stays open (needs Corbett et al. 2023 figures; REPORT.md 8 request 1); the drawn state is simply the visible 2020 container field. Nothing further can be read from this image.
- **How used (update 2026-10-06)**: No planform information (METHOD.md Step 6).

- **3D / planform check result (2026-10-06)**: Planform checked 2026-10-06: the YouTube render shows two separate leaf-shaped container fields side by side with a gap, each tilted down toward the sea like our arms (north arm longer), no flared wings. Topology agrees with the trace; the render is not to scale, so no metric check. Planform check done.
- **How used (update 2026-10-06)**: Qualitative topology check (METHOD.md Step 6).

## narrowneck-gold-coast-img-50 - Garmin Navionics SonarChart, Narrowneck Reef, zoom 18, shallow shading 0 m (series of 9 screenshots 0-8 m)

![narrowneck-gold-coast-img-50](../../../07_scale/shapes/narrowneck-gold-coast/src/navionics/sonar_z18_shade00.0.png)

- **file**: `07_scale/shapes/narrowneck-gold-coast/src/navionics/sonar_z18_shade00.0.png`
- **kind**: chart_screenshot
- **shows**: SonarChart contours (0.5 m labels) around the reef: closed 4.0 and 4.5 m loops over the north arm, a closed 4.5 m loop with a '0.9' obstruction label over the south arm, a 6 m closed loop between the arms, 5.5-6 m around, 7-10 m seaward; red dotted restricted-area polygon (prohibited anchorage) around the arms; shading n m = water shallower than n m.
- **structure visible**: True
- **state shown**: renewed (chart data of unknown date)
- **image date**: chart state of 2026-10-06 (chart data date not shown)

- **retrieved**: 2026-10-06
- **used for**: 3d_seabed, 3d_crest, cross_check, scale
- **How used for the model**: Seabed and shoal read-out for the 3D stage and a position check of the trace: the s3 arms laid on the chart (map centre = reef centroid) fall on the 4.0/4.5 m shoal loops (METHOD.md Step 5; overlays navionics_sonar_*). Depth datum is not stated by the app (assumed LAT, supported by REPORT.md 5.2); the chart shows the arms only as 1.5-2 m shoals above 5.5-6 m seabed, not the crest.
- **3D check pending**: YES - 3D agent: use the contour values (4.0/4.5 over arms, 5.5-6 around, 7-10 seaward) as an extra seabed check against Vieira da Silva 2021 Fig 3 (-4/-5 inner, -6 to -8 reef body, -9/-10 seaward, AHD; convert LAT->AHD with +0.76)

## narrowneck-gold-coast-img-51 - Garmin Navionics Nautical Chart, Narrowneck Reef, zoom 18, shallow shading 0 m (series of 9 screenshots 0-8 m)

![narrowneck-gold-coast-img-51](../../../07_scale/shapes/narrowneck-gold-coast/src/navionics/naut_z18_shade00.0.png)

- **file**: `07_scale/shapes/narrowneck-gold-coast/src/navionics/naut_z18_shade00.0.png`
- **kind**: chart_screenshot
- **shows**: The official-chart layer shows almost nothing at the reef: one spot depth '0.9' (label suffix unclear) and a 5.9 m sounding inside the red dotted restricted-area polygon, one 5 m contour west of it; no reef outline.
- **structure visible**: True
- **state shown**: renewed (chart data of unknown date)
- **image date**: chart state of 2026-10-06 (chart data date not shown)

- **licence**: Garmin terms of use; not stated per image; private research copy only, NOT FOR NAVIGATION
- **retrieved**: 2026-10-06
- **used for**: 3d_crest, cross_check
- **How used for the model**: Crest cross-check only: the single shallow spot depth 0.9 m (datum unstated, assumed LAT) is the shallowest value any chart shows at the reef; it is 0.5 m shallower than the post-2018 multibeam crest (-2.2 m AHD = 1.44 m below LAT by MSQ) and close to the 1.0 m below LAT of the 2007-2012 papers, so it probably carries an older state. METHOD.md Step 5.
- **3D check pending**: YES - 3D agent: decide whether the 0.9 m spot depth is used at all (older crest state); ask Lior to read the Navionics app label (obstruction symbol) at -27.9866, 153.4341
